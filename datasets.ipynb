    " 'They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.\\n  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the\\n  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.',\n",
    " \"But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt\\n  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be\\n  their gain.\",\n",
    " \"The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on\\n  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in\\n  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not\\n  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.\",\n",
    " 'Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs\\n  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms\\n  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the\\n  new taxes.',\n",
    " '\"We wouldn\\'t be able to do business,\" said a spokesman for\\n  leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric\\n  Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.',\n",
    " '\"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time\\n  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of\\n  exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,\" said Tom\\n  Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James\\n  Capel and Co>.',\n",
    " 'In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.',\n",
    " '\"We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S.',\n",
    " 'Threat against\\n  Japan because it serves as a warning to us,\" said a senior\\n  Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.',\n",
    " 'Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last\\n  year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.',\n",
    " \"The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves\\n  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.\",\n",
    " '\"We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and\\n  cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we\\n  want to defuse problems from possible U.S.',\n",
    " 'Retaliation,\" said\\n  Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.',\n",
    " \"A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion\\n  association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan\\n  might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports\\n  are similar to those of Japan.\",\n",
    " 'Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion\\n  dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.',\n",
    " 'In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough\\n  curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of\\n  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the\\n  U.S.',\n",
    " 'In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been\\n  selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics\\n  manufacturers share that view.',\n",
    " 'But other businessmen said such\\n  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by\\n  further U.S. Pressure to block imports.',\n",
    " '\"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills,\\n  director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.',\n",
    " '\"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will\\n  be extended to other sources.',\n",
    " 'Much more serious for Hong Kong\\n  is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.',\n",
    " \"The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,\\n  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.\",\n",
    " 'The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade\\n  talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,\\n  Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.',\n",
    " '\"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two\\n  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very\\n  serious matter,\" Button said.',\n",
    " \"He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,\\n  Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant\\n  U.S. Exports to that country.\",\n",
    " 'Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the\\n  trade stand-off continue.',\n",
    " \"Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined\\n  a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.\",\n",
    " 'The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget\\n  and record public works spending in the first half of the\\n  financial year.',\n",

    " 'It said in a statement that the two factors led to a\\n  squeeze on refining margins and an 18.24 pct fall in sales and\\n  services income despite an unchanged level of activity.',\n",
    " 'Vieille Montagne, which is actively pursuing a\\n  restructuring program, reported a 198 mln franc net loss, after\\n  187 mln francs in provisions for the closure of an electrolysis\\n  plant, compared with a 250 mln franc net profit in 1985.',\n",

    " 'Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs\\n  of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.',\n",
    " 'U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop\\n  accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,\\n  but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of \"the high\\n  potential of a continued suspension that would result in\\n  reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.\"',\n",
    " 'Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are\\n  received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that\\n  full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.',\n",
    " 'Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations\\n  between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the\\n  resumption of interest payments.',\n",
    " 'The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central\\n  bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a\\n  90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that\\n  matures on April 15.',\n",

    " 'In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline\\n  Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are\\n  among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07\\n  dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year.',\n",
    " 'Total natural gas\\n  reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet\\n  in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.',\n",

    " 'So why three jaws?',\n",
    " 'What do they need them for?',\n",
    " \"Jaws are held internally, and when they're interested in feeding, they'll spread their mouth out to create a sucker, kind of like a suction cup on a window.\",\n",
    " 'And then they push the jaws out.',\n",
    " \"And the jaw - they're muscular and lined with teeth.\",\n",
    " 'And they move the jaws back and forth to create the wounds in the teeth.',\n",

    " 'How big is it?',\n",
    " 'It varies in size - maybe an inch long.',\n",
    " 'Some of the largest specimens can be between 6 and 8 inches long.',\n",

    " 'So this is the first new find of a medicinal leech in North America since 1975.',\n",
    " 'What is a medicinal leech?',\n",
    " 'So a medicinal leech is a common name that we use for leeches that feed on humans...\\nOh.',\n",

    " 'Leeches have these anticoagulants in their saliva.',\n",
    " \"So when they bite, that causes the blood to flow and for the blood to stay liquid inside the leech once it's eaten it.\",\n",
    " 'And this has been used in medicine for many, many years.',\n",
    " \"It was most popular in the 17, 1800s in Western medicine, and it's even used today in modern medicine.\",\n",
    " \"Leeches are approved medical device in the United States, and they're used readily.\",\n",
    " 'Tell me about your collection method.',\n",
    " 'How did you find this three-jawed leech?',\n",
    " 'These leeches feed on blood, and they predominantly are probably eating blood of amphibians, for the most part - amphibians and fish and, occasionally, mammals.',\n",
    " 'And whenever a human comes into the swamp, they will feed on them as well.',\n",
    " 'Uh-oh.',\n",

    " \"House Republicans booted Rep. Liz Cheney from their leadership trio this week, replacing the Wyoming conservative with Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the shape-shifting former Paul Ryan acolyte-turned-Trump-booster who, as recently as five years ago, could barely bring herself to speak the 2016 GOP nominee's name.\",\n",
    " \"Cheney's defenestration and Stefanik's subsequent ascent were an anticlimax, and not just because the switch-a-roo had been choreographed for weeks.\",\n",
    " \"Unlike Cheney, Stefanik is a reliable messenger on the one issue, above all else, that unites Republican lawmakers in Congress and many powerful positions around the country: that former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election are gospel.\",\n",
    " 'After the dust settled on Friday, House Republicans sounded eager to move on from this particular headline-grabbing melodrama.',\n",
    " \"With Cheney sidelined, they argued, the party would be free to focus on opposing the Democratic agenda and winning congressional majorities in next year's midterm elections.\",\n",
    " \"Those imperatives, as Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy views it, were being frustrated by Cheney's refusal to parrot the party line.\",\n",
    " 'If the Cheney episode is instructive in any meaningful, lasting way, it should be to make clear that the so-called \"GOP civil war\" is anything but.',\n",
    " \"Rather, to the extent there is conflict within the party, it's a painfully one-sided rout.\",\n",
    " 'The Trumpist forces are on the march, in Congress and state capitols where voting rights are being rolled back as part of a growing suppression regime.',\n",
    " \"Cheney's resistance, for all its sound and fury, attracted no new public support from Republican ranks.\",\n",
    " 'Instead, it provided yet another platform for Trump loyalists to assert their dominance over the party -- and its future.',\n",
    " 'For her part, Stefanik marched out to put a bow on the episode, declaring that House Republicans \"are unified in working with President Trump.\"',\n",
    " 'The remark, in the context of what had unfolded over the previous few days, prompted some understandable eye-rolling.',\n",
    " 'But beneath its apparent absurdity, a bright, glowing truth was revealed.',\n",
    " \"Republicans are not only in near-perfect lockstep with Trump -- who celebrated Stefanik's promotion -- but also with the politics of Trumpism, a more potent threat to the basic functions of American democracy than the former President himself.\",\n",
    " 'Trumpism without Trump\\nIn a Friday evening interview with Jake Tapper on CNN\\'s \"The Lead,\" Cheney side-stepped the question of Republican unity and criticized the Biden administration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, before explaining her concerns over the party\\'s credibility with voters.',\n",
    " '\"We\\'ve got to be able to tell people you can trust us,\" she said, \"and trust us to be based around conservative principles and reject the lie and to protect the Constitution.\"',\n",
    " \"That her replacement, Stefanik, is by any measure a less conservative legislator than Cheney -- a point of contention among some Republican lawmakers, but not enough to halt her rise -- underscored the GOP's clear shift from a more traditional right-wing ideological bearing to a full embrace of Trumpism's particular demands.\",\n",
    " 'Those willing to stand by Cheney mostly shared at least one thing -- the \"former\" in their titles.',\n",
    " 'With the exception of Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the leaders of the anti-Trump chorus can be divided roughly into two camps: those long-retired from politics and others, like former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who said their piece before standing down to avoid serious tests of their political mettle.',\n",
    " 'A third bucket exists mostly in the states, where GOP officials -- including those, like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who blocked Trump\\'s effort to overturn the 2020 election result -- are using ginned-up concerns over \"election integrity,\" sowed last November, as a basis to back restrictive new voting laws.',\n",
    " \"Asked in March why he supported the legislation, given his own insistence that the last election had been fairly decided, Raffensperger drew a false equivalence between 2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams' protests over the administration of that election and Trump's actions last year.\",\n",
    " 'After conflating the two, Raffensperger claimed that the sum effect was a \"shot to the confidence of voters\" that needed a remedy.',\n",
    " 'In her interview with Tapper on Friday, Cheney described Raffensperger as a \"really good example of the tremendous strength of local Republican officials around the country refusing to give in when President Trump was trying to pressure them.\"',\n",
    " '\"Our system held,\" Cheney continued, \"the institutions held and there\\'s an ongoing danger and we need to stand up against it.\"',\n",
    " \"That Raffensperger didn't bend to Trump's will is to his credit.\",\n",
    " 'That he is now parlaying that credibility to give cover to a new, more subtle form of illiberalism in his home state underscores how deep the rot goes -- and that whether Trump runs again in 2024 or not, the Republican Party is more than happy to walk through the door he busted open.',\n",
    " \"Rep. Claudia Tenney offered up a similar kind of misdirection this week as she tried to squirm out of a question about Trump's post-campaign disinformation offensive.\",\n",
    " '\"No one knows about what happened in the election,\" the New York Republican told CNN on Wednesday.',\n",
    " '\"We don\\'t know if it was stolen or not, (Cheney) doesn\\'t know, I don\\'t know, the President doesn\\'t know.',\n",
    " 'But what I know is we need to fix it.\"',\n",
    " \"As anti-democratic dissembling goes, Tenney's existential journey might seem mild.\",\n",
    " 'But it is, in many ways, the most dangerous kind.',\n",
    " 'The loudest voices might get the most attention, but it is the measured ones, when peddling an outright lie about a free and fair election, that do the most to internalize the deception.',\n",
    " \"Marjorie Taylor Greene and the new GOP normal\\nSome of Tenney's colleagues have been more aggressive -- and less shameless, as they attempt to write the January 6 Capitol insurrection out of the history books.\",\n",
    " \"And they are not, as some apologists are quick to suggest, simply acting out of a fear of backlash from Trump's supporters.\",\n",
    " 'That would be impossible, in a way, because they are, in the most literal sense, representative of them.',\n",
    " 'None more, of course, than Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a freshman Republican from Georgia.',\n",
    " \"Earlier on Friday, two days after Greene personally confronted Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York outside the House chamber, CNN's KFile reported on deleted video of Greene, originally streamed on Facebook Live, that showed the future congresswoman and associates stalking Ocasio-Cortez's office in 2019.\",\n",
    " \"The New Yorker's door was locked, but the group camped out, rattling the letter slots, scribbling nasty messages in a reception book and spewing hateful gibberish to their viewers.\",\n",
    " '\"We\\'re going to go see, we\\'re going to visit, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.',\n",
    " 'Crazy eyes.',\n",
    " 'Crazy eyes.',\n",
    " 'Nutty.',\n",
    " 'Cortez,\" Greene says at one point, mispronouncing \"Ocasio,\" before continuing to taunt and yell at staffers inside the office.',\n",
    " \"By McCarthy's logic -- the one that guided his support for Cheney's ouster -- either of the two episodes involving Greene and her dangerous fixation on Ocasio-Cortez might be cause for concern or even the meting out of some intra-conference discipline.\",\n",
    " '\"Each day spent re-litigating the past is one less day we have to seize the future,\" the minority leader had written in a letter to his members before they voted on Cheney\\'s fate.',\n",
    " '\"If we are to succeed in stopping the radical Democrat agenda from destroying our country, these internal conflicts need to be resolved so as not to detract from the efforts of our collective team.\"',\n",
    " \"But for those waiting on a statement of similar concern over Greene's latest transgressions, better to not waste much time standing by.\",\n",
    " 'Trolling and harassment -- remember, this is not the first time Ocasio-Cortez has been verbally attacked by a Republican House member -- are not, apparently, the kinds of behaviors that earn one a substantial reprimand from GOP congressional leaders.',\n",
    " \"Tempting though it might be to dismiss Greene as a back-bencher with little influence on much of anything that takes place at her day job, she is, for all the mess, a rather neat encapsulation of both Trump's power and its limits.\",\n",
    " 'Though she is a political disciple of the former President, she is hardly taking orders from him.',\n",
    " 'Greene is the unfettered id of the Republican Party in 2021, a sideshow character who feeds on confrontation and a scorn for Democrats and the basic function of government.',\n",
    " 'That kind of political nihilism, and the popular support that delivered it to Congress, cannot be reasoned away.',\n",
    " \"And it is there that Cheney's high-minded rhetoric, ultimately, falls short, along with Democrats' appeals to decency.\",\n",
    " 'Greene is not susceptible to it and Republicans -- even the more performatively mainstream among them -- have no interest in rooting out the Trumpists now filling their ranks.',\n",
    " 'President Joe Biden was at the wooded Camp David retreat in Maryland when he first heard Colonial Pipeline had been hacked.',\n",
    " \"Briefed in one of the mountainside lodges by senior advisers and aides from the National Security Council, Biden quickly realized the incident -- and subsequent shutdown of the company's pipeline supplying fuel to the Eastern Seaboard -- could easily devolve into a major problem.\",\n",
    " 'Long lines of cars at pumps and handwritten \"no fuel\" signs make for potent political imagery, a fact Biden experienced firsthand when as a young senator he saw an oil crisis help deprive President Jimmy Carter of a second term.',\n",
    " 'The pipeline shutdown was the first in a string of unexpected events in the past week that have tested the President and his aides.',\n",
    " 'A day later, violence would begin rapidly escalating between Israelis and Palestinians, lighting up telephone lines between Washington and the Middle East and thrusting Biden back into a conflict riddled with failed US efforts at brokering peace.',\n",
    " 'Alarm bells for the still-recovering economy began ringing in new inflation numbers midweek, setting up fresh political hurdles just as Biden was entering a critical stretch of negotiations with Republicans over his $4 trillion in new spending.',\n",
    " 'Before the pipeline shutdown, aides said the President had been planning to spend the weekend getting updates from advisers on the labor market -- including on why the jobs report the previous Friday proved so disappointing.',\n",
    " 'Thursday brought a more welcome surprise, albeit one that still caused a scramble.',\n",
    " 'The timing of new mask guidelines for vaccinated Americans from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention caught some aides off guard and have prompted a confusing rush in states to update their rules.',\n",
    " 'White House officials had been anticipating the CDC would soon make changes, but many believed it would take the notoriously slow-moving agency until later this month to decide on the new recommendations.',\n",
    " 'Until now, Biden had mostly been spared the types of quickly spiraling foreign crises or surprise domestic emergencies that compose any presidency.',\n",
    " 'His plate has instead been filled with longer-term issues -- like recovering from the pandemic -- or tenacious problems, like a surge of migrants at the Southwestern border.',\n",
    " \"But the past week amounted to a reality check for a President who has placed nearly all of his political capital in ending the pandemic and enacting a boldly progressive agenda, having spent months focused on getting shots in arms and stimulus checks in Americans' bank accounts.\",\n",
    " 'The simultaneous foreign and domestic crises would challenge even the most seasoned president, let alone one charged with navigating the country from its worst health crisis in a century.',\n",
    " 'They serve as a reminder that any manner of crises can intervene to throw the trajectory off course.',\n",
    " \"'You have to be prepared'\\nPublicly, the White House assumed a calm demeanor toward the developments, even as concerns about the potential political fallout pervaded.\",\n",
    " 'Aides said Biden is no stranger to surprises, having witnessed and responded to them for eight years as vice president.',\n",
    " '\"That\\'s what we\\'re made for here,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday.',\n",
    " '\"We certainly know that -- and the President knew from having served as vice president for eight years -- that when you walk in and you\\'re the leader of the free world and you\\'re overseeing a country that is still working its way through a pandemic and an economic recovery, that you have to be prepared to juggle multiple challenges, multiple crises at one time,\" she said.',\n",
    " 'An energy crunch is near the top of that list.',\n",
    " 'Aside from watching Carter struggle to contain a nationwide gas shortage in 1979, Biden saw firsthand how President Barack Obama strove to manage the political fallout from the BP oil spill in the early days of his presidency.',\n",
    " 'After his initial briefing on the hack last Saturday at Camp David, Biden asked for updates every day by members of his staff.',\n",
    " \"The White House's concern over the issue was plain as Cabinet secretaries came to cameras each afternoon with new measures they were taking to alleviate shortages.\",\n",
    " 'Republicans seized the opportunity to compare Biden to Carter, even though the pipeline shutdown was prompted by Russia-based ransomware hackers who penetrated a weak private-sector network.',\n",
    " 'Biden himself chose to deliver an update Thursday once the pipeline was back online.',\n",
    " '\"This is a whole-of-government response to get more fuel more quickly to where it\\'s needed and to limit the pain being felt by American customers,\" he said from the Roosevelt Room, taking credit for \"extraordinary measures\" that would provide enough gas to fill the tanks of 5 million vehicles.',\n",
    " 'Yet the question of the nation\\'s cybersecurity remained, and Biden suggested Thursday that he wasn\\'t ruling out a counterattack on the criminal syndicate responsible for the Colonial Pipeline hack, saying, \"We\\'re also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate.\"',\n",
    " 'By Friday, the ransomware extortion website used by the group responsible for the cyberattack had gone offline, according to cybersecurity experts.',\n",
    " \"The President said he'd raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin at their upcoming summit, expected next month when Biden visits Europe on his first foreign trip.\",\n",
    " \"Attention turns back to the Middle East\\nThe episode seemed to confirm Biden's belief that areas like cybersecurity, Russia and China present today's most serious foreign threats.\",\n",
    " 'Yet an urgent foreign crisis in the Middle East has occupied much of the national security attention at the White House this week.',\n",
    " \"As some of the worst violence in years broke out between Israelis and Palestinians, the region's long-entrenched battles are dragging Biden back in.\",\n",
    " 'A US official told CNN that the President on Saturday spoke with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas -- the first conversation between the two leaders since Biden assumed the presidency.',\n",
    " 'Biden also spoke Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the official said.',\n",
    " 'Those conversations come amid the heightened concern about civilian causalities in Gaza.',\n",
    " 'Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Benny Gantz Saturday, with Austin tweeting about the conversation, \"I reaffirmed Israel\\'s right to defend itself and condemned Hamas\\' deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians.\"',\n",
    " \"A White House official told CNN earlier in the day that internal meetings would be held Saturday on the escalating violence, as well as on the administration's infrastructure push.\",\n",
    " 'The President had also spoken with Netanyahu on Wednesday.',\n",
    " 'At the State Department, the Pentagon and the office suite of the National Security Council, a flurry of telephone calls had gone out to Israeli and Palestinian leaders, along with officials in Egypt and Qatar who the US hopes can help broker a ceasefire.',\n",
    " \"It's not necessarily the foreign policy issue Biden wanted to be confronting in the early months of his presidency.\",\n",
    " 'Amid the chaos, he spoke publicly about the violence only when questioned by reporters.',\n",
    " 'Officials said they believe the President can play a more productive role in private discussions, including with Netanyahu, than in making proactive public statements.',\n",
    " 'Officials are also mindful of the delicate -- and somewhat new -- political pressures Biden is facing on the matter.',\n",
    " \"Though he has been versed on this issue for decades as a lawmaker leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and later as vice president, a growing strain of Democratic politics has been harshly critical of Israel's actions.\",\n",
    " 'Even his boilerplate statement that Israel has a right to defend itself invited a rebuke from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who said \"blanket statements\" like Biden\\'s \"dehumanize Palestinians & imply the US will look the other way at human rights violations.\"',\n",
    " 'Biden and the White House have shown little willingness to bend to that pressure.',\n",
    " \"Speaking the next day at the White House, the President said he did not detect a disproportionate response to Hamas' rocket attacks from Israel, which has launched airstrikes in Gaza.\",\n",
    " 'And over the course of the week, he focused far more public attention on domestic matters, including the still-fragile economy.',\n",
    " 'After the badly disappointing jobs report last week and midweek numbers showing a spike in inflation, Biden and his aides have tried to explain that the economy is still in the unpredictable early stages of recovery.',\n",
    " '\"We are in the midst of restarting this economy in earnest, and we are making good progress in doing so.',\n",
    " 'However, we must keep in mind that an economy will not heal instantaneously,\" said Cecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, on Friday.',\n",
    " 'The White House downplayed inflation concerns by saying the new data reflects pent-up consumer demand that some suppliers cannot immediately meet.',\n",
    " 'But even leading Democratic economist Larry Summers used the troubling numbers to urge the White House to shift course from distributing Covid relief funds, which he blames for increased spending and inflation.',\n",
    " '\"Policymakers at the Fed and in the (White House) need to recognize that the risk of a Vietnam inflation scenario is now greater than the deflation risks on which they were originally focused,\" Summers told CNN\\'s John Harwood.',\n",
    " 'Mask guidance catches White House off guard\\nGiven the spate of unwelcome developments that had percolated in the days leading up to it, the CDC announcement Thursday made for a welcome -- if still unplanned-for -- development.',\n",

    " 'ET on Wednesday that the guidance was changing, and word did not spread widely in the West Wing until later the following day.',\n",

    "lean_right = ['Over Memorial Day weekend, Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, appeared at a QAnon-affiliated conference in Dallas.',\n",
    " 'During a Q&A session, an audience member asked, “I want to know why what happened in Myanmar can’t happen here.”\\n\\nWhat happened in Myanmar was an old-fashioned military coup.',\n",
    " 'Flynn replied, “No reason.',\n",
    " 'I mean, it should happen here.”\\n\\nThe crowd cheered both the question and the answer.',\n",
    " 'I bring this up not to dwell on the fact that this is disgraceful and dangerous stuff.',\n",
    " 'Flynn, a retired general, has been saying loony things for quite a while.',\n",
    " 'No, I bring this up to ask a different question: Why aren’t more conservatives and elected Republicans more horrified by this and stuff like it?',\n",
    " 'The timing of Flynn’s remarks was darkly fortuitous, and not just because he offered his comments on the eve of Memorial Day, when we honor the men and women who gave their lives defending our Constitution.',\n",
    " 'Flynn’s comments also coincided with a spirited debate about the nature of conservatism, and whether the right’s descent into such conspiracy-mongering paranoia and nationalism is a betrayal of conservatism or the inevitable result of conservative ideas.',\n",
    " 'Some even argue that this is what conservatism was always about.',\n",
    " 'It’s certainly true that the Trump era has revealed a lot about how serious—or, rather, unserious—some prominent Republicans and conservatives really were about their reverence for the Constitution.',\n",
    " 'But instead of going down various intellectual and historical rabbit holes, I’ll just say that trying to lay this at the feet of conservative ideas is a distraction.',\n",
    " 'The core problem afflicting the right—and to a great degree, the country—is that the elite surrender to populism.',\n",
    " 'Definitions of populism vary, but for our purposes it’s best understood as the politics of the mob.',\n",
    " 'The defining emotion of populism and mobs alike is passion, fueled by the invincible twin convictions that “we” are right and that “we” have been wronged by “them.” It’s a bit like Charles de Gaulle’s line about the difference between patriotism and nationalism.',\n",
    " '“Patriotism is when love of your own people comes first; nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.”\\n\\nPopulism is often immune to reason and contemptuous of debate.',\n",
    " '“The people of Nebraska are for free silver, and I am for free silver,” William Jennings Bryan proclaimed.',\n",
    " '“I will look up the arguments later.”\\n\\nBoth parties have, at various times, hitched their wagons to populism.',\n",
    " 'Andrew Jackson, William Jennings Bryan, Huey Long and George Wallace rode the populist tiger, while Franklin D. Roosevelt and, to a lesser extent, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama harnessed the beast for their purposes.',\n",
    " 'Conservatives deserve special criticism for fomenting populism because conservatism is supposed to be temperamentally skeptical of excessive political passion.',\n",
    " 'But that decision has less to do with conservative ideas than with the corruption of prioritizing political power over principle—an error that is inherent to politics and human nature, as the founders understood well.',\n",
    " 'Certainly, on paper, intellectual progressivism provides as much permission for indulging populism as conservatism does.',\n",
    " 'The surrender to populism was greased by what Marxists call “material conditions.” Institutions of all stripes—the media, organized religion, education, etc.—have lost much of their ability to temper passions.',\n",
    " 'This is in part because of the deeply entrenched cultural conviction that passion and feelings trump facts and arguments.',\n",
    " 'Thanks to a generation of polarizing culture-war politics, mass self-sorting of voters into rival camps, and misguided reforms that gave populists outsize power to dominate primaries, Congress no longer serves its proper function as the place where political disagreements are worked out.',\n",
    " 'It’s now a giant stage for political theatrics and popular-front policing.',\n",
    " 'The media has become balkanized.',\n",
    " 'When most Americans got their news from a handful of outlets, extremism was filtered out of the national conversation.',\n",
    " 'Such gatekeeping is gone, because the walls that made the gatekeepers powerful have been demolished, and many of the erstwhile gatekeepers would rather lead the mob than tell its members to lay down their pitchforks.',\n",
    " 'The new business model, fueled by social media, is to grab a relative handful of “sticky” customers seeking to have their passions ratified, not rebutted.',\n",
    " 'The former hierarchies of credibility have been flattened.',\n",
    " 'Anyone with a web browser can find the “facts” the mob needs.',\n",
    " 'In short, the right changed with the times.',\n",
    " 'Its problem now is that it rode the tiger so long, it doesn’t know how to get off—and it’s not even sure it wants to.',\n",
    " 'Following a statement from the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on September 24 announcing an FBI inquiry into “reports of potential issues with a small number of mail-in ballots at the Luzerne County Board of Elections,” the slim details available led to viral misinformed claims about what occurred in the Pennsylvania county.',\n",
    " 'A few hours later, the FBI issued a letter to the Luzerne County Bureau of Elections and released a revised statement, both of which provided more information about the mail-in ballots in question, corrected some errors in the first announcement, and directly discredited some of the viral claims on social media.',\n",
    " 'However, such claims have persisted online, with some posts relying on outdated information and others making entirely unsubstantiated claims.',\n",
    " 'It should be noted that despite the confidence with which many of these claims are made, the FBI’s inquiry is ongoing and has not determined what precisely happened.',\n",
    " 'Here are the details that we know thus far:\\n\\nAccording to the initial statement from U.S. Attorney David Freed: “Investigators have recovered nine ballots at this time.',\n",
    " 'Some of those ballots can be attributed to specific voters and some cannot.',\n",
    " 'All nine ballots were cast for presidential candidate Donald Trump.” Some news stories and social media posts continue to claim that all the ballots were for Trump, but the FBI quickly corrected the figure: Both the letter and revisited statement state that seven of the ballots were cast for Trump, with two of the ballots’ votes unknown as they had been resealed.',\n",
    " 'Some claimed that the ballots were found in a ditch: There is nothing to support this in either the initial statement or later statements from the FBI.',\n",
    " 'The letter to the Luzerne County Bureau of Elections notes that “the majority of recovered materials were found in an outside dumpster.”\\n\\nThe Luzerne County Board of Elections said that the ballots were mistakenly opened because of how similar the official envelopes used were to those used for mail-in ballot requests.',\n",
    " 'The FBI’s letter states: “It was explained to investigators the envelopes used for official overseas, military, absentee and mail-in ballot requests are so similar, that the staff believed that adhering to the protocol of preserving envelopes unopened would cause them to miss such ballot requests.” The letter also notes that this was “a known issue” during primary elections.',\n",
    " 'The county manager of Luzerne issued a statement in which he claimed that the error with the ballots occurred because of a temporary seasonal independent contractor brought on to assist with the election season.',\n",
    " 'The county is now contacting voters whose ballots were mistakenly opened to ensure their vote is counted.']"
