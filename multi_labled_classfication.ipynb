XXXX  acknowledged the error and refunded my card. Citibank has rebilled me for the transaction. \\n\\nD XXXX dated XXXX for {$42.00}. I disputed {$42.00} on XXXX due to the condition of the order and XXXX  failing to issue a refund as promised. I withdrew the case on XXXX because the merchant issued a refund. I proactively spoke to the merchant about this dispute as well due to Citibanks accusation that I had misrepresented disputes, specifically mentioning the {$18.00} dispute ( executive office employee XXXX ). To date, Citibank has not reversed the dispute on my account. I e-mailed billing dispute XXXX that I would withdraw the dispute when the charge came through on the account and explained they entered the amounts incorrectly. XXXX  messed up when processing the refund which was stated in the email. They entered it in two amounts : {$4.00} and then {$46.00}. So, it doesnt match the original disputed amount of {$42.00}. They actually refunded more than was due. I think he confused the refunds since the other purchase amount was {$46.00}. Seems he most likely ran {$4.00} first by accident and then ran it again for {$46.00}, although he stated something about confusing it with my tipped amount of 10 % on the {$46.00} bill. Who the XXXX knows at this point. I brought the error to his attention. He stated he didnt think it was a big deal, XXXX  has plenty of money, and he wasnt worried about getting me extra money back. As shown in the e-mail, I offered to repay him for the difference. He said no. Obviously, he couldnt rebill because the account is now closed. As you can clearly see by the e-mails, I explained in detail to one of the other managers who forwarded the e-mail to the other manager. It clearly breaks down the disputed amounts to {$18.00} and {$42.00}. The financial operations manager also has the right figures, because she pulled each dispute for investigation. I think the way he applied the refund is part of the rebill problem. Citibank isnt able to properly match up the figures. \\n\\nFinally, XXXXs operations manager thought they were not paid on these items initially. She stated, While I often send them copies of receipts for records, we don\\'t actually expect to get anywhere with the disputes, as we don\\'t have chip readers and therefore we\\'re automatically considered at fault for any fraud/disputes either way. Anyways, here \\'s what I found with their card number : I received a chargeback from XX/XX/19 for XX/XX/19 for {$42.00}. I sent merchant services a copy of the receipt and just accepted the charges since it was noted as \" defective merchandise/services \\'\\'. I received a chargeback from XX/XX/19 for XX/XX/19 {$18.00} for a {$46.00} ticket. I sent merchant services a copy of the receipt. I marked on their checklist that I was sending them a signed copy of the receipt. I didn\\'t leave any notes or state anything past that ... they often just ask for a copy of the ticket. Not sure why they told her we said they never complained. I wouldn\\'t personally have knowledge on whether the guest complained. Not sure if merchant services would have talked to someone else or what? But I definitely didn\\'t say anything to them. It is weird that the guest would go through merchant services rather than the restaurant for product/service issue. Normally that\\'s just used for fraud ... so I understand why the credit card company might question whether they are trying to scam the system. I just checked our credit card processing system and it looks like the {$18.00} chargeback did hit our account. I\\'ll paste a screenshot below. Is the guest asking about the {$18.00} because merchant services hasn\\'t credited her or what is she needing? I\\'m not following that part. \\nI told them it shouldnt matter whether they have a chip reader or not, all disputes should be handled the same way. I also stated disputes arent just used for fraud and referred them to the FTCs link on reasons for disputes. I reached out to billing disputes by e-mail, and XXXX  states they rapidly reached out to them. Here is the response : I have spoken with XXXX again and have ensured that everything financially is cleared on our end. Merchant services reached out from the bank, and we have verified that the purchases were made and were valid for credit. We are not sure why they would be saying we were refuting your dispute claims, however ... And we have been appropriately recompensed for the previously mentioned instances as well. \\nThere was a misunderstanding on my end initially, and I have applied the {$18.00} credit to your account today. You should see it posted to your Citibank account within the next 24 hours. \\n\\nPlease let me know when the credit hits your account. \\n\\nIve never been so confused on a dispute and the explanations involved in my life. They thought they werent paid initially but merchant services says they were once they reached out to them. Are they filling out disputes incorrectly? \\n\\nI am requesting written documentation on D XXXX including the merchants response. I dont need it on D XXXX because Citibank sent me a letter apologizing for the confusion. \\n\\nPlease try to get this problem fixed. I have been trying to fix these problems for weeks and I am worn out. On another note, they burned another pizza. This time I took pictures and complained directly to them in writing. I am having to seek a refund through XXXX. I am so tired of this location screwing up and don\\'t plan on dining at this location ever again. I have attached pictures of it so Citibank \\'s executive team can clearly see XXXX burns pizzas, even though it clearly isn\\'t related to this dispute. XXXX should have never accused me of lying about the XXXX   dispute, saying I made no effort to say anything at the time about the pizza, I didn\\'t seek a refund, and implied it wasn\\'t burned. I think the only thing off on the dispute is probably that we dined in the restaurant. I must have been confused when I entered it in the dispute system. \\n\\nTo be clear, when eating at XXXX, you can order through the line for dine-in or carry out. If there is a problem with the food, a customer tells the manager on duty and he or she can process the refund based on the receipt alone. Same if you complain over the phone. The refund just didn\\'t get applied, period. XXXX  isn\\'t the first restaurant to make this kind of mistake. We eat out all the time. We spend about {$1200.00} a month on dining out. We put nearly $ 46k in charges on the Citibank card last year ; we used it for everything. Mistakes happen at the restaurant level. All restaurant managers and owners will tell you that. Managers get busy, forget to apply the refunds in person and over the phone, and forget to send out gift certificates or promptly issue refunds all the time. Three instances that I have had in the last two weeks alone are XXXX XXXX, XXXX \\'s and XXXX.

It took me several months to demonstrate that I sent my coverage back in XX/XX/XXXX.

Ditech takes your complaint seriously and appreciates this opportunity to respond. Ditech regrets that you feel you have been mistreated in any way during the servicing of your loan account. Ditechs mission is to provide exceptional levels of service and it is Ditechs policy to treat every customer with respect. Pursuant to your request Ditech has confirmed that a do not call has been placed on the account.

Meaning that they didnt solve the problem, they just passed the burden to my principal account, at my cost. No solution was taken by Ditech regarding this issue. \\n\\nBottom-line, they havent corrected this issue accordingly, and to show CFPB what its the logic behind this ordeal, I have written the following statement for your view and analysis : Ditech have been servicing my account for more than 3 years and since then I dont understand why my payment had increased and changed so many times after XX/XX/XXXX, when my property taxes, which is the only payment made by Ditech from my escrow account, has been dropping since XXXX. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX - {$610.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$620.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$630.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$650.00} I only have to accumulate an amount in escrow for my property taxes, so please get somebody from Ditech to analyze and explain why this mess has been originated by Ditech. \\n\\nIn addition, my principal was increased to cover your mistakes or errors from {$110000.00} to {$110000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, an increase of {$1100.00} that have to be credited back to actualize my real principal amount. \\n\\nI have opened my case several times without success, but I want to conclude this matter to move on with my life.

When the supervisor came on it was hard to hear him because of a poor connection on his end. On top of that he had roosters and chickens crowing in the background so loudly that I could not hear. I asked him if I was hearing chickens and roosters and he said yes. That he was working from home and there was nothing he could do about it. He can't control it. I told him I also have pets in my home but I went to an area of my home were it was quiet so I could hear and not be disruptive. He did not care. I finally ended the call as it was not productive and I could not hear him. \\nAs a side, this same merchant charged me on XX/XX/2020 for the remaining balance of the vacation I had canceled. That charge was for {$2900.00}. I also filed a dispute with Citi for this charge since the trip was canceled. Citi did find in my favor for this charge and made it a permanent credit on XX/XX/2020.

XXXX XXXX XXXX CHOSE TO IGNORE THAT MY LOAN WAS WITH XXXX/XXXX   AND FAILED TO PROVIDE ME THE RELIEF IN WHICH IM ENTITLED TO AS A RESULT OF ALL OF XXXX/XXXX   SETTLEMENTS. \\nThis modification from XXXX XXXX XXXX only steered me ( a struggling homeowner ) into a risky modification ( in spite of me receiving no relief from XXXX/XXXX illegal actions upon me and numerous settlements in which Im entitled to receive relief and still have not ), by offering interest-only loans instead of permanent modifications. Instead of modifying my mortgage into a stable affordable permanent modification, XXXX modified my loan into an unaffordable loan modification with ballooning monthly payments I can not afford. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX failed to make a good faith effort to avoid foreclosure for borrowers whose mortgage loans have unfair subprime terms. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX  appeared to favor short-term, interest-only mortgage modifications rather than permanent ones, even when a permanent modification was commercially reasonable. Then when the initial term of the mortgage expired, myself and borrowers would see mortgage payments balloon to an amount even higher than what I originally was paying and could not afford, setting me up to continue to face foreclosure. \\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX entered into a settlement which reflects a continuation of enforcement actions by the department and its federal and state enforcement partners to hold financial institutions accountable for abusive mortgage practices. The settlement parallels the {$25.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) reached in XX/XX/XXXX between the federal government, 49 state attorneys general and the District of Columbias attorney general and the five largest national mortgage servicers, as well as the {$960.00} XXXX settlement reached in XX/XX/XXXX between those same federal and state partners and XXXX XXXX  XXXX. This settlement with XXXX is the result of negotiations that, as has been reported in XXXX XXXX plcs Annual Report and Accounts, began following the announcement of the XXXX. \\nUnder the agreement announced today, XXXX  has agreed to provide more than {$470.00} XXXX in relief to consumers and payments to federal and state parties, and to be bound to mortgage servicing standards and be subject to independent monitoring of its compliance with the agreement. More specifically, the settlement provides that : XXXX  will pay {$100.00} XXXX : {$40.00} XXXX to be paid to the settling federal parties ; {$59.00} XXXX to be paid into an escrow fund administered by the states to make payments to borrowers who lost their homes to foreclosure between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ; and {$200000.00} to be paid into an escrow fund to reimburse the state attorneys general for investigation costs. \\nBy XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX will complete {$370.00} XXXX in creditable consumer relief directly to borrowers and homeowners in the form of reducing the principal on mortgages for borrowers who are at risk of default, reducing mortgage interest rates, forgiving forbearance and other forms of relief. The relief to homeowners has been underway and will likely provide more than {$370.00} XXXX in direct benefits to borrowers because XXXX will not be permitted to claim credit for every dollar spent on the required consumer relief. \\nXXXX will be required to implement standards for the servicing of mortgage loans, the handling of foreclosures and for ensuring the accuracy of information provided in federal bankruptcy court. These standards are designed to prevent foreclosure abuses of the past, such as robo-signing, improper documentation and lost paperwork, and create new consumer protections. The standards provide for oversight of foreclosure processing, including third-party vendors, and new requirements to undertake pre-filing reviews of certain documents filed in bankruptcy court. The servicing standards ensure that foreclosure is a last resort by requiring XXXX to evaluate homeowners for other loss-mitigation options first. In addition, the standards restrict XXXX from foreclosing while the homeowner is being considered for a loan modification. \\nIn addition to the above, and predicated upon the banks mortgage abuses XXXX/XXXX reached an agreement with federal agencies to address its mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure abuses in the amount of {$470.00} XXXX and to provide {$370.00} XXXX in creditable consumer relief to benefit homeowners across the country and to reform their servicing standards. General Counsel XXXX XXXX of HUD stated : Mortgage servicers have a responsibility to help struggling borrowers remain in their home, not to push them into foreclosure. This agreement is another example of how multiple agencies in the federal government and state attorney general across the country are working to make sure the mortgage industry treats consumers fairly. This agreement not only provides relief to borrowers affected by XXXX  past practices, it puts in place protections for current and future homeowners through tough mortgage servicing standards. They were mandated to help prevent past foreclosure abuses. This settlement agreement was entered into ( XX/XX/XXXX ) for {$600.00} XXXX with a series of federal agencies by the DOJ, HUD, CFPB and 49 states and the District of Columbia for XXXX/XXXX  engaging in these abusive mortgage practices. ***IN SPITE OF THIS SETTLEMENT, AS OF THIS INSTANT DATE, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY MORTGAGE RELIEF WHATSOEVER IN SPITE OF MY LOAN ORIGINATING WITH XXXX/XXXX  AND BEING TRANSFERRED/SOLD NUMEROUS TIMES TO AVOID PROVIDING THE RELIEF IN WHICH IM LEGALLY ENTITLED AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED*** I HAVE NOT WAIVED ANY OF MY RIGHTS TO THE RELIEF IN WHICH IM ENTITLED AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED. \\nIn spite of all of these numerous settlement agreements by XXXXXXXX, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY RELIEF TO WHICH IM ENTITLED. \\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  reached an agreement on these types of false modifications they entered into with struggling homeowners ( I HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN ANY RELIEF FOR THESE ILLEGAL ACTIONS UPON ME ). XXXX XXXX XXXX  was required to put a new loan modification program in place and review borrowers who currently have interest-only or short-term modifications to provide them more sustainable, affordable modifications. My interest-only fraudulent modification expires in XX/XX/XXXX. \\nI HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY RELIEF FROM XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT XXXX/XXXX IS MY LOAN ORIGINATOR ).

Well upon checking with my bank I was told they had received no such deposit ( rejected/pending/posted or otherwise ). They stated they received no transaction from Google or anyone in the amount of {$34.00}. I proceeded to make Google aware of this, only to continually be told it had indeed been sent. It was my bank that was wrong and my bank withholding or delaying the funds. I proceeded to explain to them the contrary.

Again, I receive alerts saying to please verify your account by submitting the following documents for reinstatement. Well again, I proceed to submit daily these documents, to then within minutes to hours receive the same notification as before. After review of your documentation your account will remain suspended, etc, etc. Long short of this is I have spent hundreds of hours now attempting to get back my {$34.00} that should have never been taken, seized, frozen, or otherwise from the onset. As this decision was without merit and I believe done rather out of retaliation for my subsequent poor reviews of Google products, apps and my strong opinion of what I consider to be an otherwise incompetent company regarding their handling of this.

Following graduation, I opened a credit to begin planning an engagement ring purchase to propose to my current wife - the love of my life. \\n\\nIn every instance mentioned above, borrowing money was necessitated by the amount of money available to me in order for me to exercise my constitutional rights to life, liberty, and pursuit of am happiness. \\n\\nWhile the standard American Dream of going to college, getting a job, getting married, buying a house, and having kids was deeply engrained in my life growing up, financial education was not.

       " 'There is a workaround banks are using to earn finance charges. A {$5.00} charge that is paid in full by the statement due date accrues no interest. A {$10000.00} balance transfer at 0 % carries month to month within the promotional period accrues no interest. As independent transactions this holds true and correct. However, if during the 12 month 0 % promotional period for the same {$10000.00} if the same {$5.00} purchase occurs the consumer now must pay {$10000.00} dollars by the statement due date or be assessed finance charges on the {$5.00}. GOT-YA clause essentially. They stipulate the entire statement balance must be paid to not accrue finance charges in order to either circumvent many of the intentions of the Consumer Credit Act of 2009 or the banks threw enough money at lobbyists in order to leave this sort of a loophole for them to exploit. Given this scenario with a statement balance of {$10000.00} the consumer makes a payment of {$250.00}. In accordance with the Credit Act they will apply the payment to the highest interest rate first which means that {$5.00} purchase is being paid by the first statement due date following the purchase. Since there is a remaining balance left on \" the statement \\'\\' of {$9700.00} they can apply finance charges. So despite the balance transfer and purchase transactions being independent and XXXX has nothing to do with the other because they exist on the same single account the banks will penalize the consumer with finance charges. It \\'s apparent and obvious this was devised in order to still reap profits through shady fine print details. The Credit Act should be amended to stipulate that new purchases or new cash advances can not be stipulated based on a lower balance transfer promotional offer existing. Essentially forcing segmentation exist within the singular line of credit. This retains all existing rules but breaks this loophole. Not only will payments apply to the highest interest rate but under any circumstance in which a new purchase or cash advance occurs the payment is applied to the newest transactions first and finance charges can only be applied to the carries balance. Break that down so in month 1 the consumer uses a balance transfer of 0 % for 12 months on {$5000.00}. In month 2 the consumer makes a {$200.00} purchase and on the next statement in which the {$200.00} is shown the consumer makes a payment of {$300.00}. This covers the {$200.00} purchase and this no finance charges may be assessed and the remaining balance is {$4900.00}. In month 3 the consumer makes a purchase for {$1500.00} and on the next statement in which this {$1500.00} is shown the consumer makes a {$1000.00} payment. The bank can only apply a finance charge based on the remaining {$500.00} balance carried over from the {$1500.00} purchase. In month 4 the consumer has no new transactions. The previous month balance is {$5400.00}. The bank can apply finance charges on the accounts daily average balance \" of purchases \\'\\' or {$500.00} for that month. The consumer makes a payment of {$2400.00}. This pays off all purchases and no further interest can be assessed. In month 5 the account balance is {$3000.00} plus the accrued interest on the previous months carried balance. The consumer makes a payment in month 5 that covers the interest amount and then some additional toward the remaining balance transfer amount. In month 6 all that remains on the statement is the remaining balance transfer amount. This is what \\'s right and prevents banks from leveraging the balance transfer as a way to sneak in finance charges. Consumers should not have to dissect things in order to realize that they really need an entire account solely used for balance transfers and another account for purchases/cash advances. This forces a situation where consumers must have multiple accounts and catches consumers in unintentional finance charges due to the legal verbiage used.',\n",

As soon as I was aware, I reached out to SPS to let them know I was in the remodification process with XXXX, and to see how I could proceed. They told me that they would continue to process, and that the could use the information and forms from XXXX. That was the case until late XX/XX/XXXX, when they told me that I would have to start the process all over, using their documents and paperwork. \\n\\nI got started on this in XX/XX/XXXX, knowing that there was a sale date for my property soon. It had been a long time since I started the remodifciaiton process. The original housing agency I was working with ended up closing, which forced me to do this on my own with XXXX. \\n\\nSPS said to get my packet in before the XX/XX/XXXX, and they could postpone/stop the sale until my remodification packet was reviewed. Even if it was n't correct or if they needed additional information, they could get that later, but that it was most important to get it in. I did, and spoke to someone at SPS on XX/XX/XXXX who told me that paperwork was sent to the attorneys to postpone the sale. Since XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to SPS on several occasions as they needed different paperwork and documents. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter via mail that my property had been sold on XX/XX/XXXX. This was baffling to me because I was told the sale had been postponed, and because I had spoke to SPS multiple times since then. On XX/XX/XXXX I spent the entire day talking to SPS, HUD, my Housing Agency ( Transitions ). On XX/XX/XXXX, my final call with SPS, I was told they were putting in an escalation to have the sale resended, as it should not have been sold, and because my remodification was still under review. Additionally I was informed that XXXX sold it, and bought it, so it was still with SPS. I was advised to call every few days to check for updates, which I did. I was originally told that it would take 10-14 days for and update or action. On XX/XX/XXXX I was told that it would actually take 4-6 weeks. When I called on XX/XX/XXXX it was as if the escalation never took place. SPS told me the escalation to resend could not move forward without HUD 's approval. HUD made clear this was an issue with SPS and they could and should resend it and allow the remodification to be reviewed. Both HUD and my Housing Agency suggested I contact you, the attorney general, and an attorney as they felt like SPS had n't gone through the correct process, and had not communicated with me, and sent me around in circle. \\nAdditionally, SPS has NEVER, EVER reached out to me. I have never, ever spoken with my assigned relationship manager. They only communication I have had with SPS is when I call them, even though I have made perfectly clear that my number is and independent, private number where they can leave a message. SPS has never reached out to me. And, I get conflicting information every time I called.\",\n",

       " 'it recently came to my attention that springleaf financial services and XXXX company are involved in fraud and forgery, on XXXX separate loans springleaf financial took money from my loan proceeds and purchased private life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance policies other than the credit loan products that are usally offered when taking out a loan. springleaf financial failed to disclose to me that these unrelated private life insurance products were added to my loans I had no use for these products I had already purchase the credit life policies I needed. The loan documents put before me were not the documents that were neatly packaged by springleaf prior to disclosure. leading me to believe that the documents put before me were the same ones in the package which I did not examine at that time. I was completely unaware that springleaf ever sold these private life insurance policies and to top it off springleaf named themselves lien holder of these policies they stole money from my loan proceeds to purchase. springleaf nor XXXX never sent me any policies within thirty days to examine nor did they include signed certificates of insurance in either loan package I knew nothing about these private policies. I first contacted merit life insurance after becoming aware on XX/XX/XXXX about one of the policies after discovering this while checking to see what my pay off would be. after this XXXX XXXX sent to me a forged certificate of insurance they ordered and that I had never seen before or signed for {$26000.00} dollars that did not expire until XX/XX/XXXXand the policy sent to me does not even have the policy number on it. if I had ordered this policy I surely would have named a beneficiary but there was none and if I had not discovered this springleaf and merit life would still be in possession of this policy long after my loan had been paid off. these documents are being forged by cut and paste from other documents I may have signed. after this I checked a previous loan and sure enough springleaf and XXXX had included a private life insurance policy and paid for it with my loan proceeds I only owed XXXX dollars which I had already taken the credit life insurance to cover this loan. The undisclosed private life insurance policy was for {$7700.00} this is {$5000.00} more than my actual loan this policy did not include a beneficiary either, and another question who orders a life insurance policy for the odd amount of {$7700.00}.? this took place in XX/XX/XXXX the most recent undisclosed private life insurance policy took place in a loan in XX/XX/XXXX so this tells me this is a intentional common practice of springleaf financial and XXXX this is why they are so rich just think if a private insurance policy is added to every customers loan without being disclosed and is not discovered because this information is hidden on the backside of the page of the loan disclosure documents put before the customer during disclosure by springleaf csr who intentionally fails to flip the page over that states they first offered me the loan proceeds they used to purchase these private policies which is a total lie. Do you actually believe that I would take out XXXX of these policies that cost almost more than the loan proceeds that I received? All of the customers loan documents dated XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX should be checked for these bogus life insurance policies that were added and not disclosed to customers in order for springleaf financial and merit life insurance companys benefit.',\n",

       " \"Greetings. In XX/XX/XXXX, I hired a short sale specialist to list for sale a property I was awarded in my divorce, which had been finalized months earlier. The divorce cost me all of my savings and left me both with huge unpaid debts ( mostly legal fees ) as well as an investment property that had significant negative equity and a tenant who was n't paying her rent. \\n\\nThe house listed for seven months and received offers but Chase would not process the short sale because I was able to remain current on my payments. In XX/XX/XXXX, Chase advised the office of my listing agent that I would need to skip a payment for the short sale to proceed. In XX/XX/XXXX, I cancelled the auto-payment on the loan for that month only, effectively missing that payment. In XX/XX/XXXX, payments resumed and continued as before. In XX/XX/XXXX, Chase informed my listing agent that they would not agree to the short sale. That same month, in addition to remaining current on the monthly payments, I made a XXXX payment to cover what had been skipped -- again through Chase 's prompting -- in XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nWhile this matter did not help my financial picture, which had not significantly improved over this time, it should have squared me with Chase. However, it did not. In spite of advising my listing agent that a missed payment was required in order for them to process the sale of the property, Chase actually raised my monthly payment as a result of the skipped payment. And even though after said skipped payment, my payments continued as before in a timely manner, Chase repeatedly treated these as both past due and insufficient because they had raised dramatically the amount held escrow on my mortgage and implemented late fees as a penalty for the XXXX skipped payment, effectively diminishing the effectiveness of payments. \\n\\nThe home has since been re-listed again by the same short sale agent, and nothing has changed. In the meantime, even though, my net payments to Chase per terms of my original mortgage should be square, they have continued to report my payments as rolling 30 day late and have escalated the the reporting of late payments and fees associated with the XXXX skipped payment. \\n\\nThe result has been decimation of my credit and intractable movement on any processing of the short sale. I remain underwater and in debt for the property only now with greatly damaged credit, a higher mortgage payment and undue fees and charges. This is not a creditor working with their borrower. This is a creditor who advised via my listing agent to skip a payment for their own underwriting practices and then used that to attack my credit and further diminish my ability to manage my debt load to them as well as my overall debt burdern, which precipitated the whole issue to begin with. \\n\\nChase should proceed with the short sale of the home. If not, they should give me the option of giving them the deed in lieu of payment or offer to rescind all assigned late fees, acknowledging the effects of their own procedures as well as my own good faith efforts to both follow their lead and to reconcile with them after they originally denied the short sale. They should at minimum expunge the missed payments ( aside from the XXXX ) from my credit report and either work on the short sale or a mortgage modification to deal with this distressed property.\",\n",

However, I believe that Wells Fargo bears financial responsibility for hosting a payment system that is so easily exploited by criminals.

She would call everyday, sometimes 2 times a day. After that conversation, she continued to call. And again, sometimes twice from what my colleague at work tells me. I have logged all the times she has called if needed. I also mailed a written request to not call my work number in the future. She still calls. I understand they are concerned about receiving their payments, and I have never been 30 days late, and if they pay attention to their own website they know when I schedule my payment. I understand that if I pay late, I have to pay the late fees etc. And I do. The last conversation I had with her was borderline harassment. She was insistent that I come in and sign a paper for a deferment. I was 15 days late? I told her there was no need. I will pay the late fees. She did n't seem to like that answer. So I get a letter in the mail to sign for a deferment. Which I tore up. I do n't mind if she calls me at home, she can leave a message anytime. But I do n't want to be harassed any longer.

I have personally contacted both the creditors and the credit bureaus and disputed these claims alone. All pursuant with the understanding followed by, The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. \\n\\nI am a victim of a high case of fraud, I have only begun studying on how to navigate this new reality of credit with research and proper knowledge. I discovered very quickly what kind of darkness has been happening throughout all of these years with out my conscious awareness or consent. Its time to put my education to work and I have decided its time to make calls and take control of this disgusting mess. I will be more smooth and open in writing with this introduction for the CFPB and much more unsparing in the letters awaiting the bureaus and creditors involved. \\nXX/XX/XXXX is one of the bureaus that claimed to have removed ALL of the unauthorized hard inquiries off of my history due to my request of placements and statements of multiple fraudulent reports, show casing the unverifiable sources connecting to my profile. Trans union is taking precautionary measures to insure they are communicating with the correct individual before any removal of such claims, even after openly discussing I have never incurred any debt, never activated a line of credit and no history of credit ever. This is why these claims were placed under fraud with an added security monitor as alertness of any further illegal usage of my identity. There appears to be fraud under my identity withXX/XX/XXXX as well, they treated me with the same skepticism as Trans union did. After contacting them both directly they are still unsure of the identity of whom is calling, Respectably so, In stating my answers orally as none of the above, when answering the security questions designed for me amongst the XXXXhree bureaus. It rose suspicion upon their agents that I can not answer which banks are involved or which credit card accounts are currently activated, the existing loans or collections reported, etc. Understandably, despite the skepticism I immediately requested them to place those claims under fraudulent activities as well as any of the existing loans or collections to be frozen and investigated immediately. Only If this happens to be the true information held against my identity Illegally. I use a trusted third party credit monitoring system/service known as XX/XX/XXXX. This service allows me to pull a three-in-one credit report involving all of the three bureaus, accurately. In observing my report I was notified XX/XX/XXXX does not have any information of me being existent in their files. During my time of communicating with the agents from each bureau I took the opportunity and attempted to fix my general information such as Name, Date of birth, Current and Previous address, SSN, and Employment. I say attempted, under the confusion if these actions were implemented across all bureaus since Trans union and XX/XX/XXXXdenied to give me validation, aside from XX/XX/XXXX. However, the agents that were involved from each bureau assured me orally that the changes has been updated for my personal information. I had been given instructions to take action by the bureaus and begin contacting the creditors directly to dispute these claims I have encountered ( as done so already, in which they only sent alerts to the bureaus as to ensure them I have called and placed a flag on such claims yet I was informed they can not personally remove any history as that is the role for the bureaus to operate ). After that short briefing of knowledge I than requested for them to please delete all existing information from their personal system data base under my identity as so, they have obtained it illegally. The bureaus suggested I should seek into filing a police report as well and furthermore, to than compose a cover letter by following specific instructions as of what to include and a description of what it is that I would like to be done. This is expected to be sent through certified mail or fax. As for the Police report, it still is under construction as I have not approached them for I must attempt to obtain certain documents in order to file one and the process to obtain them is absurd. My case is known as The Credit Invisible profile, therefore anything opened with my name is immediately fraud for I havent begun this endeavor of credit until recently ( 10 days ago ) meaning I have just began studying what goes into this process and discovered these harsh crimes.',\n",

I am sure everyone agrees this is the very best way for transparency and assure neither side is limited to the facts. However, PNC claimed my original dispute was MISHANDLED. and requested another detail list of all the transactions. This seemed strange to me, they have a recording of the conversation, therefore a record of everything said. Why would PNC bank REFUSE to access their own record? Further, PNC bank continued attempts to have my 2nd dispute over the phone. Why would I provide them another dispute over the same format they admitted mishandling and refuse to acknowledge having? Therefore, I provided a 2nd dispute in writing on XX/XX/XXXX, through PNC banks own Messaging platform, this way there is no discrepancies or possibility of any attempt to claim it was NOT received, right?

If pnc bank reports the balance to include the disputes transactions as accurate it will trigger the FCRA violation standard allowing me to sue. interesting what the CFPB intends to handle this, because by PNC banks own actions they are sending a clear message that the CFPB has zero leverage with them and PMC clearly has no respect for federal agencies.',\n",

       " 'My American Express Gold and American Express Platinum cards were canceled in XX/XX/XXXX due to the misapplication of payments I\\'d made since XX/XX/XXXX ( see CFPB complaint XXXX-XXXX response dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). Per the American Express card agreement my payments are due upon receipt and are accepted thru the first of each month. The ten ( 10 ) day grace period allows them to be received without any late payment charges thru the XX/XX/XXXX calendar day of the month. All payments ar allocated first to cover the pay-in-full portion of a card member \\'s plus the minimum payment due on the pay-over-time portion of the account. \\n\\nPer American Express own written statement to the CFPB dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, American Express admits that an overage was applied to my Pay-Over-Time Balance, on the date of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) dollars and that having received a total of processed payments in the amount of XXXX between XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, an overage from the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX payment plus prior payments within the same time-frame were applied to my pay-over-time balance. \\n\\nTo quote the signed statement submitted by American Express to the CFPB with CFPB Ref No : XXXX-XXXX and dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : \" An over-payment of {$3600.00} was allocated to the Pay Over Time balance. \\'\\' Now, the payment was made on XXXX XXXX and was therefore intended to be credited towards the immediate balance due on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. That payment was not to be used to in-full to reduce the pay-over-time balance within the statement period. As a result, every subsequent statement period reported that my account was nearly thirty ( 30 ) days past-due, ultimately leading to the closure of my accounts and reporting of invalid adverse credit history to the three ( 3 ) major CRA \\'s. \\n\\nIt is perfectly reasonable to pay a balance due on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX one ( 1 ) week in advance ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), especially considering that American Express previously lost my payment that was WIRED, and for whatever the reason was unable to process other payments. So, American Express has apparently concocted a scheme such that if a payment is made AFTER the closing of a statement period, but before that statement period balance is due, their computing system will misapply payments made prior to the exact due date for that statement period, for all card members who have the pay-over-time functionality on their charge cards. That is, American Express is able to take in two times ( 2 ) the pay-in-full balance due under threat of reporting adverse credit history if only the payment due is made within one ( 1 ) week before the due date of the payment. Again the payment is technically due upon receipt and in my case was expected to be paid by the XX/XX/XXXX of the month, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nAn investigation was conducted regarding the payment history resulting in American Express having to change the due dates of ALL my statement periods between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX because there was no other way to correct the error in the computer system. In American Express \\' statement to the CFPB on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX with CFPB Ref No : XXXX-XXXX, American express states : \" On XX/XX/XXXX a credit supervisor called you per your request. He was able to obtain an exception to remove the delinquency. We have provided appropriate feedback to his leader to prevent this from happening in the future as we are obligated to report accurate information to the credit reporting agencies. \\'\\' That is, the supervisor that assisted me in trying to make things right to the extent they COULD be made right given the series of colossal screw-ups in the way my XXXX XXXX payment was REPRIMANDED for having done so -- apparently no good deed at American Express goes unpunished. If the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX payment had been applied as it was intended to be, there would have been no \" late payment \\'\\' and no need for the supervisor to have had to take the extraordinary actions to fix the issue regarding the reporting for XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nNow, I chose to be respectful and to try and resolve the issue internal to American Express between XXXX of XXXX thru the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX date, as mentioned in American Express \\' XX/XX/XXXX statement. However, if I\\'d chosen to file with the CRA \\'s and asked that the invalid credit history be removed, and provided information indicating that a payment was misapplied, that information would have been removed because American Express does not even dispute the date a payment was made, but in how they chose to apply a payment made within one ( 1 ) week of the due date for the statement period. \\n\\nAs a prior American Express shareholder outright, and one that most-likely continues to be a shareholder through index/mutual funds, it is alarming to see this sort of behavior in how American Express treated me as a card member, and shareholder, AND how they treat their employees who try to retain card members that have been harmed due to flaws in their computing system logic, whether those employees are in the United States, or abroad. The sad thing is that I am a millennial -- it is statistically the single most-difficult group that American Express has tried to attract to it\\'s products and services. \\n\\nAt this point American Express has chosen to keep my accounts closed, despite admitting to a misapplication of payments, AS I INTENDED THEM, and per their own statements to the CFPB. Their consolation has been to offer me \" guaranteed reinstatement \\'\\' once the pay-over-time portion of my account is paid in-full with a risk-exposure limit that pales in comparison to the prior limit. With the stiff competition in the marketplace in terms of credit cards, especially for \" up and coming \\'\\' millennial making well into six-figures like myself, it would behoove American Express to re-evaluate how it treats its card members overall, especially millennial card members like myself. While I am not privy to the level of disciplinary action that was taken against the supervisor that assisted me, it\\'s unfortunate that I would even need to state that American Express should consider looking inward on how it treats employees who attempt to reset a relationship with a card member that has been harmed due to an error in payment allocation. \\n\\nThere are a series of steps that American Express must undertake if they wish to keep me as a card member after going through this with them for the past one ( 1 ) year. If American Express can not do ALL of these things as I have specified as a fair resolution, then it will be clear that I am not valued as a card member and that American Express has not learned their lessons with millennials and brand loyalty. \\n\\nUnder that scenario, I will work with another financial institution that I currently have accounts with, explain the situation and provide the copious documentation of this experience with American Express and part ways with AXP as a card member. Furthermore, I will limit my exposure to AXP in any of my index/mutual fund holdings. \\n\\nRegardless, I will provide feedback to the CFPB and request that the feedback be posted so that other consumers will be aware of just how American Express chooses to treat its millennial customers.',\n",

They stated I lived in a false address that I've never lived in..however that address is a location of base but not the physical address of my location and many military members have been victims of this because the address is a address affiliated to the location of the base but is NOT an physical address of any member located or stationed at that base as that base has individual addresses within the base. this company has harassed me with the name of XXXX XXXX and wrong numbers and tried to have me verify information to try to prove their case more accurately to collect money from me that i do not owe. They've been doing searches to try to solid their information because their information in the beginning was inaccurate.

This card was never late as it automatically paid. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Was proven to be a false account against member but is still reported as accurate information. It was proven based off the time the member resided at the location. The member wasn't at the location 1 year and half after this report was sent out the account was reported in which the member was still living in location when information of XXXX  orders and location of new address proved that member was in a whole different state during the billing time the company sent reporting and the company failed to provide accurate information connecting member to this account. Inaccuracy by the company and lack of accountability of the company who reported it. Member is not legal responsible for this account and this information should have been updated and removed off his credit report. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX  account is being held as a late account when account is paid in full and proved it was never late from almost 8 years ago. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX  reported 90 days vehicle payment late however member did call bank ahead of time that it would be a possibility that this may occur ahead of time and had provided to the bank that he was a military member deployed and was injured in the line of duty and was medically retired and could not make payments because of hospitalized because his of injuries during wartime of defending our country. He then paid in the same year his debts up. And this was because it took time for the military to execute retirement payment so that member could pay bills. This should be excused based on the contingencies of military member pause in pay because they don't get paid with the immediate release out of the military at the same time military member did take care of the issue immediately after as bank requested. Member has been up to date since then. \\n\\nXXXX  XXXX XXXX same issue with vehicle payment above. 90 days vehicle payment late however member did call bank ahead of time that it would be a possibility that this may occur ahead of time and had provided to the bank that he was a military member deployed and was injured in the line of duty and was XXXX  retired and could not make payments because of hospitalized because his of injuries during wartime of defending our country. He then paid in the same year his debts up. And this was because it took time for the military to execute retirement payment so that member could pay bills. This should be excused based on the contingencies of military member pause in pay because they don't get paid with the immediate release out of the military at the same time military member did take care of the issue immediately after as bank requested. Member has been up to date since then. \\n\\n\\n\\nThis member has a total of 24 positive accounts Longevity of their accounts is exceptional. However we can all see that during the time the member was injured in the military they clearly had an hiccup in finances however not in the control of the member but in the actions of defending their country. In no way should we look the the other way in issues at hand but we need to see the trend and the analysis of this member bounced back from that year until now. And because of the credit bureaus not accurately keeping up with his progression had caused a devastating blow to this XXXX military member way of living. They served 20 years of dedicated service and and we thoroughly look how they kept up with payment management overall within those years we can clear see there is a red flag on how this members credit has been managed by the bureaus and this is not fairly done. If we are going to report information it needs to be on time and accurate as it happens. It beneficial to members that work hard to keep the accuracy of their credit score as a major responsibility because its apart their transition of life. it's already hard transition from military to civilian as it is. And we are doing a disservice to this member. Look at this FICO score this member has 4 Auto loans and never has been late, two houses on record and sold with no missed payments, Time share of earned property, no bankruptcies on file and has managed his account with the upmost respect at the same time defending our country. How is that we feel comfortable with evaluating his credit score at the level as teen or someone that don't pay their bills on time. 24 exceptional accounts to maybe 3 to 4 delinquent accounts does not symbolize such a score. FICO has given member a Auto loan score of XXXX how is that possible? That's clearly inaccuracies and a severe error amongst credit reporting agencies if member maintains 4 auto loans up to date without error with these banks satisfied and the last issue member had was back in XXXX where he was transitioning out the military with making the ultimate sacrifice with defending his country. His FICO House loan credit score is a XXXX? So are we stating that his previous home loans don't count? We are telling this member that everything he has done responsibly with 20 years of service and his retirement income that they get on a monthly basis doesn't matter? The bureaus are reporting they have and income of $ XXXX? Their excuse is from the banks? How so? the average military member with 20 years of service is almost $ 30K plus if not more.. So lets highlight this.. the credit bureaus and FICO bureaus are reporting this member as being XXXX in debt with a $ XXXX income.. how? has 4 auto loans, Timeshare, living expense, credit cards and the last dated collection was dated back in XXXX and that's still questionable and being disputed for accuracy because it was around the same time member transitioned out the military.\",\n",

My balance transfer of was also erroneously listed in that section under \" Balance Subject to Interest Rate \\'\\' as {$56.00}, instead of the actual amount of {$3700.00}. These numbers are erroneous in numerous ways : they don\\'t add up with the purchase I made ( there are not {$1800.00} in purchases itemized on the statement, only the one for {$87.00} ), none  of my purchases should be charged interest until after the introductory period is up on XX/XX/XXXX, and the incorrect balance transfer amount listed in the \" Interest Charge Calculation \\'\\' section.

My statement lists {$390.00} in itemized purchases during that period. The balance transfer amount is now listed as {$110.00}, and my \" Introductory Purchase \\'\\' amount is {$110.00}.

I reported {$450.00} of fraudulent charges on the day I discovered them, but the investigation stated that the charges were legitimate because I benefited from the transaction. I later learned because there are other charges made with the card during that period that I did not dispute, the fraud claim is denied. Additionally, I am being charged twice for the same purchase that occurred around this time. \\n\\nMy Chase Visa was lost/stolen on XX/XX/XXXX. Due to the Coronavirus stay at home order and non-contact purchases ( XXXX XXXX ), I did not notice that the card was gone until XX/XX/XXXX when I received the bill for the charges. At that time, I noticed 35 fraudulent charges totaling {$450.00} - all to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. ( Although these merchants are in my neighborhood, I have never purchased anything from them ). I immediately reported these fraudulent charges, locked my card, and was issued a replacement card. There are other charges on my card ( to XXXX XXXX ) which I did not dispute, as I assumed they were legitimate ( my husband still had possession of his card during the time, I always use XXXX XXXX and they are made at neighborhood stores we sometimes go to ). However, my failure to identify these charges which I might have made as fraudulent is now Chases grounds for denying the entire fraud claim. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, prior to noticing the fraudulent charge, I purchased an item online at Amazon using the card ( which is saved to my account ), totaling {$350.00}. This payment was settled with Amazon on XX/XX/XXXX but later was disputed by the bank. According to correspondence with Amazon, the bank removed the funds from Amazon ( Chargeback ID : XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX. My Amazon account was then locked. I contacted Amazon, provided my replacement credit card number and was re-charged the amount. This was added to my Chase bill and paid off in XXXX. Chase has placed the initial charge back on my account. Chase is now demanding that I pay for both charges ; Chase employee stated by phone that the merchant was paid twice. However, the merchant denies this ( record of chat with Amazon attached ). \\n\\nI asked for a review of the fraud claim. I subsequently was called and interviewed by someone from another country over a very poor, almost inaudible, phone connection made less intelligible by the accent of the staff member I spoke with. I explained that my husband still had his card which is why there continued to be charges on a credit card, and that my card was indeed lost/stolen but I had not noticed due to the stay at home order. This same individual told me that Amazon was paid twice, and I would need to contact Amazon to be refunded the {$350.00} ; ( this proved to be incorrect per Amazon. ) This individual gave me the impression on the phone that the  information I gave was sufficient to validate my claim regarding the {$450.00} of fraudulent charges. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed a letter in my Chase account stating that The latest review confirms the previous finding that the transaction ( s ) is valid, as well as the infuriating statement We assure you that we researched your fraud claim thoroughly. I was given a phone number to call with questions, XXXX, extension XXXX, which is not answered and just goes to a busy signal. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX I attempted to reach the regular fraud department by phone. I called on four different occasions. Each time, after holding for 10-30 minutes was disconnected. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, after a 40-minute hold time I was finally able to speak to someone through a very poor phone connection which was barely audible. I explained that I am planning to complain to the Consumer Finance Protection Agency and was transferred yet again to Ms. XXXX, an escalation specialist. Again, the hold time was excessive, and the phone quality was poor. Ms. XXXX insisted that the fraudulent purchases were actually my purchases because I used my chip card at that time to go to XXXX. \\n\\nThere are indeed charges at the local XXXX which they claim are the reason they are denying the fraudulent charges. Since I often shop at the same XXXX I did not claim these as fraudulent because I was not 100 % sure that my husband or I did not make purchases at that time using his card or XXXX XXXX ; they were for small amounts and not something I would clearly recall weeks later. However, if they were made with the same card chip, they are indeed fraudulent, and I should not responsible for those charges either. \\n\\nMs. XXXX then required that I file a police report ( which I consider a waste of time and police resources. ) I was not told what to do with the police report. I was then transferred to someone to dispute the {$350.00} duplicate charge at Amazon. I was placed on another long hold. After an additional 30 minutes I was told I would be transferred to XXXX who would assist with duplicate charges. However, I was transferred, and the call went to a busy signal and I was disconnected. \\n\\nChase customer service is abysmal, and they persist in charging me for purchases that I am not responsible for.',\n",

BOA had an alternate email address on file - never used it. They had my phone number on file - never called me.

This is negatively affecting my life as we are looking to buy a new home and will be forced to pay a higher interest rate should this matter not be resolved. Over 30 years that will equal tens of thousands of dollars. All because Bank of America never thought to utilize the alternative forms of contact available to them to send me a bill for {$110.00}. And because apparently to the credit bureau - that 's a crime worth a lifetime of credit built. This is just not adding up to me. It feels wrong. This is my last resort.

On XX/XX/XXXX, my ex-wife received correspondence from Wells Fargo Card Services addressed to XXXX XXXX at her address welcoming me to their credit card family. A copy of the letter is attached. Included in the envelope was a credit card stating to call to open the account for use. My ex-wife gave the material to my daughter who emailed me in XXXX asking what it was all about. I told her that I did not open any account with Wells Fargo and for her to shred the credit card which she did ( email attached ). My Social Security number was on the documentation but the name was not the name I use for ANY purposes. I use XXXX XXXX XXXX or my full name XXXX XXXX XXXX - NEVER simply XXXX XXXX. I called Wells Fargo and was directed to the XXXX XXXX to a research and remediation analyst and explained this fraudulent issue. After some weeks, Wells Fargo sent me a letter ( copy attached ) stating they found no fraud had occurred and that the credit card was activated ( which it was not - it was shredded ). Further correspondence from Wells Fargo was very confusing in that they referred to TWO different accounts - one ending in XXXX and another ending in XXXX. They have failed to explain the two different accounts. One refers to a balance of {$5000.00} ( even though I was told that the card had a {$4500.00} limit ).

       " 'My family and I were impacted by Hurricane Irma in the month of XX/XX/XXXX which brought on unexpected and undue stress. Until Tuesday, I \\'d never been so humiliated by a company in all of my life. \\n\\nI called the company the day before ( XX/XX/XXXX ) my payment was due to find out if there was anyway to defer the existing payment because I was struggling to make ends meet after having to unexpectedly be away from home for 8 days. When I contacted the company, I was advised by the rep that there was a program in place that could defer the payment until my next due date. I was then asked by the rep if I would be able to make the payment by my next due date and I advised him at that time that I would need until XX/XX/XXXX because that \\'s when my husband receives his XXXX from the government and he would need to make the payment for me because I \\'m not currently working. The rep said ok and he \\'d submit the documentation for the deferment. \\n\\nI continued to receive calls daily ... sometimes twice per day from XX/XX/XXXX almost through the end of the month. One of the representatives told me that the deferment had been submitted and approved and I should n\\'t be receiving any additional calls. That was before the end of the month. I ca n\\'t recall the exact date. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I received an email from a rep by the name of XXXX stating that \" we \\'\\' tried to get my account resolved. First of all, I do n\\'t recall ever speaking with her and could n\\'t understand why I was receiving an email about my account instead of a call ... since there was a so called \" issue \\'\\' with a previous arrangement. I immediately responded to the rep by calling the telephone number she provided in the email. Once XXXX answered, I was rudely advised at that time that my account was 31 days past due and the deferment that was promised was declined on XX/XX/XXXX with NO notifications, NO correspondence via mail, NO emails, and NO phone calls. When I asked why my account was showing past due for 31 days, I was told the company was hit with so many request for hurricane deferments that they ran out of money and many of the deferments had to be declined. Lacking empathy for the fact that my family had to be uprooted for over a week, I was then given the option to make two payments to bring the account current. I was completely taken back by everything that was going on and baffled at the fact that the promise this same company made to ensure my account would be secured. I reminded XXXX of my conversation with the initial rep from XX/XX/XXXX ... stating that my husband has been making my payments for the past 4-5 months on the first of every month and funds would n\\'t be available  until XX/XX/XXXX for my regular payment. I also told her that I was due to start a new position within the next couple of weeks and I would work towards bringing the account current ... even though it \\'s their fault why it \\'s past due for 2 payments. XXXX then offered me the option to postdate a payment for the XX/XX/XXXX for a regular payment and she would at that point submit a request for a deferment based on me making a payment on that date. She advised me to call my bank to find out if the payment would withdraw by the XX/XX/XXXX to ensure I do n\\'t incur any overdraft fees. I told her that I was n\\'t comfortable with that and it was unlawful and poor business practices to tell me to use funds that are clearly unavailable. She then began to ask, how was I able to make payments before the XX/XX/XXXX in prior months. I explained to her, if my husbands deposit is made early ... I make the payments early to ensure my commitment to them is fulfilled. I did n\\'t realized me being responsible would be detrimental. I offered to postdate a payment for XX/XX/XXXX for a regular payment and XXXX declined. She told me to make the payment on XX/XX/XXXX on their website and she would continue to look for ways to assist me with my account. She also said hopefully additional hurricane assistance would be available at that time. That call lasted for 1hr. \\n\\nI continued to receive calls from that day until now. Today I received a call from XXXX at XXXX. She acted as if she did n\\'t remember anything we previously discussed or if none of the information I requested to have documented in its entirety was before her. She proceeded to ask for a payment equivalent to 2 monthly payments. I declined ... reminded her that my husband gets paid on the XX/XX/XXXX and I \\'d be willing to make a single payment at time and that their inability to process my deferment was due to their negligence. She continued to ask for the payment ( s ) and I continued to state what should \\'ve already been documented based on our previous 1hr conversation. I could n\\'t take anymore and requested to speak with a manager because I needed to get this issue resolve and was hoping to speak with someone willing to fix their error. \\n\\nI get a manager named XXXX. \\n\\nXXXX had to be the epitome of rude, belligerent, and obnoxious. He began by asking me when I could make a payment. Since he failed to read the notes and/or review my account ... I decided to educate him on what was going on with my account and why even receiving the call. XXXX NEVER acknowledged that the company \" dropped the ball \\'\\'. XXXX NEVER apologized for the added frustration this company was causing. XXXX chose to mock me, be extremely rude, vindictive and dismissive of the fact that my credit and credibility is being ruined because his company did n\\'t fulfill their promise. He continued to place the responsibility of making the payments on me. He continued to give me ultimatums ... \\'\\' If you do n\\'t let me talk. I wo n\\'t process your deferment. \\'\\' \" If you do n\\'t postdate the payment by XX/XX/XXXX, we wo n\\'t submit the request for the deferment today and we ca n\\'t help you. \\'\\' Appalled by all that was being said, I decided to ask for clarity on why the deferment was ever declined. He started by saying that it was n\\'t because the company ran out of money and literally ended by saying the following \" Due to the size of our market and based on the timeframe of your request ( XX/XX/XXXX ) we were unable to process the request before the end of the month. When the hurricanes occurred in Florida and Texas we had a variety of requests and deferments. Since the request was n\\'t completed by the end of the month, it was declined by the XX/XX/XXXX. \\'\\' Without notice ( no calls or written correspondence regarding the hurricane deferment )!! \\n\\nSo basically, because someone was unable to process my request by month end ... they decided to decline. NOT because a payment was n\\'t made. NOT because I needed to submit paperwork and did n\\'t, but because THEY did n\\'t get to in time. \\n\\nI asked XXXX to fix my account and he continued to ask for PAYMENTS ( XX/XX/XXXX ... that should \\'ve been deferred and XX/XX/XXXX that I \\'ve said on numerous occasions would be paid by XX/XX/XXXX ). When XXXX looked at my payment history he said ( mocking ) \" Well you made payments by the due date XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX ... then on the XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX of the following months, so why ca n\\'t you do it now? \\'\\' I reiterated that if my husband gets paid from the government for his military XXXX early I pay it early. \\n\\nRealizing I was getting nowhere fast and my XXXX XXXX numbers were ...

I stressed that even if they were unable to uncover the true reason for the error, that they still supply a plausible reason for the error. XXXX indicated that she would be willing to enter a Work-order to have that investigation and letter supplied to me. She did take a moment to ask the Investigation Department if they could think of a possible reason to explain this. She said that they indicated that it is possible that if it were a phone payment, it could have been misapplied. Another possible reason is that the computer system could have caused the error. \\nReceived Email with Letter from US Bank XX/XX/XXXX The letter was brief, with a couple of details. It mentioned that back in XX/XX/XXXX, the payment transaction went through on the XXXX of the following month. It was reported late to the credit bureau, but was then corrected, acknowledging that the effective date was the XXXX of the necessary month. At that time ( if I understand it correctly ), the credit bureau was notified that the late payment entry should be removed. This did not, however, explain why in XX/XX/XXXX, when I filed a dispute, did the XXXX late payment once again show up on my credit file. I had made a previous request to XXXX and XXXX at US Bank about this. \\nThis letter also made a brief note that the XX/XX/XXXX US Bank records did not indicate that this payment was late. I was having trouble trying to understand why it would show up on my credit file which I have a copy ( and screenshot ) of. As a reminder, when I filed the dispute in XX/XX/XXXX, the determination was made that XXXX should have not been on my record ( for the past three years ). As a result of that dispute and determination, the XXXX late payment record was removed from my credit file. In my previous conversations with XXXX and XXXX, I requested from both of them that I needed answers in a couple areas. 1. I needed to know why XXXX had been listed as a late payment since XXXX. I also wanted to know what work was done to determine that it should be removed after I filed my dispute. 2.  How did XX/XX/XXXX all of a sudden show up on my credit report as being 30 days late. This hadnt been reported previously, meaning since XX/XX/XXXX. How did my dispute of XX/XX/XXXX prompt a review/discovery/change to XX/XX/XXXX? I wanted to know how this happened. Was this a manual discovery or a computer discovery? The main takeaway here is that the letter I received did not spell out why these things happened. As a result, I called US Bank on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. \\nCalled US Bank XX/XX/XXXX Spoke with XXXX. I explained that I had just received a letter from US Bank with intentions of explaining that the XX/XX/XXXX payment was originally entered as late in XXXX, but soon after, corrected. I also spoke with her about the statement in the letter about XXXX. I requested that XXXX pull up the same letter if it were available. She did find the letter and we talked through it. She understood my concern when I explained how I did not get all of the answers that I was looking for as previously requested to XXXX and XXXX. XXXX also found those historical conversation/notes in my file. She agreed that I deserve an explanation on why the XXXX and XXXX errors happened. She told me that she would file a request that someone work to find out why this happened and send me a letter explaining this. I reminded her that I made this similar request to XXXX and also XXXX. XXXX said that it is possible that someone was still working on that letter but that her request would hopefully prompt them to complete this task. I asked her how long it would take for the credit bureau to get an update on the XXXX error. She stated that it was reported on XX/XX/XXXX and the correction to my file ( at the credit bureau ) should happen very soon. I told her that I would allow a short period of time to pass in anticipation of the letter explaining the details of the errors and would call back at a later time. We ended the conversation with that. \\nCalled XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Spoke with XXXX # XXXX. I explained the situation in brief and that I am curious why my XXXX  credit file still shows that the letter was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. He described that they also sent a copy to the credit bureau and should have arrived by XX/XX/XXXX. I explained that the missing information ( not contained in the letter ) surrounds my request to know WHY this happened in the first place. That is, how XXXX had originally been added and how XXXX was added later. He said that he needed to escalate the call to a higher authority. I was put on hold. Then XXXX # XXXX came on the line. I explained to her that I am seeking a letter to explain what had happened in XX/XX/XXXX that caused an inaccurate reporting to the credit bureau as well as the removal of that month after I disputed it, but the XX/XX/XXXX getting added as a late pmt. to the credit bureau. That caused me to do more work in disputing that month as well. I am also wondering whether or not the credit bureau has been notified. I asked WHICH ONES were notified. She took a brief timeout to read the notes listed in the file. I was put on hold. When she came back on the line, she mentioned that it was quite a long file and that she was still reading the notes. I told her that it was totally fine and that I would wait. Then she came back on the line and said that the correction letters were not detailed at all. She said that she was going to request that the investigation team dig into this and supply a letter. I explained that she is now # 4 on the list that would work to get this info. I asked how it would be possible for her to make this happen. I said I was worried that 6 months from now I would be talking to the 22nd person that would be making a similar promise. I asked her if she understood my concern. She said she looked at the names and recognized some of them. She said that she has a bit more experience than them and wanted to really get to the root cause. She then said she needed to put me on a brief hold. She came back on the line and said, it appears that they are NOT going to explain why it happened. They did not say why they would supply that information. She said that they always notify all XXXX. She said that the info has already been sent, but its a problem that they told them that XXXX should be listed as correct but NOT XXXX. I explained that the law only provides a certain amount of time. She said that as of today, the credit bureau does NOT know that XXXX needs to be removed. I said that I was trying to get a loan and that my interest rates would be higher as a result of this problem. I asked if, due to this clumsy error, this could be escalated and that the credit bureaus could be notified quickly. We both concluded that they do not yet know that XXXX needs to be removed. I could hear in the background her typing very quickly. She put me on hold once again. She came back on the line and said she is looking at the notes. She said that she was hoping it would get accomplished by XX/XX/XXXX. I said thats a huge delay. She said someone would get an email to rush this. I asked if I could get an email. I asked if the letter could be emailed once its complete. She put in the request. I told her that US Bank did this very same thing last time. We discovered that that the error was telling US Bank that XXXX needed be cleared, and not XXXX like it should have been. She went back into her system to look at XXXX of XXXX and it shows that XXXX was not late. I explained that for the past 3 years, neither XXXX or XXXX has shown to be late on my credit file. It was only added just a couple months ago. I told her that if she looked at that same file 3 months ago, XXXX would NOT show as late. She said she would leave this urgent request open to have this investigated. We ended the call after a total of 59 minutes and 51 seconds. \\n\\n\\n\\nCalled XX/XX/XXXX Spoke with mortgage dept. I asked to be connected with the research department that was working on my file. The assistant put me on hold, then came back on the line to say that she was checking into it. Her name was XXXX ID XXXX. I explained that I was hoping to get an update on where the Investigation Team was at with my file. She said that the file had not yet been updated and that they were still working on it. I asked from her working history if she could tell if there was actually a difference between something that was put on rush vs something like this that was handled in a normal fashion. She indicated that this was the first time she had seen something be put on rush. I told her I would probably just wait until Monday to call back. She said that she was actually going to suggest the same thing. I thanked her and we ended the call. \\n\\nI received a letter from US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. It was dated XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. It states that the XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX installments reflect as current. \\nI spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ID XXXX I asked her to pull up the letter I just received. She read the letter and did not comment. Went back to review the pmt. history. She commented that XXXX was actually late. I made her aware of the effective date. \\nI asked her to re-read the letter. She agreed that it seems to read that XXXX and XXXX were current. \\nAt this point I am unsure what the credit bureau has on file. \\nShe said she needed a moment to check on something. I was put on hold. She came back on the line stating that she spoke with a Supervisor and that XXXX and XXXX are considered on time from a US Bank standpoint. She said it could take up to 30 days for the credit bureaus to update their files. \\nIt is interesting to note that it states that they submitted a correction for XXXX when XXXX is actually the problem. Why would this letter state that information submitted is accurate when they had to make a correction for XXXX? \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX After sending the letter ( stating XXXX and XXXX current ) to XXXX, I called US Bank once again. XXXX with XXXX ID # XXXX. I described the issue. She confirmed that XX/XX/XXXX was received on time. She said the file was closed. I told her that XXXX STILL remains at XXXX. I explained my frustration. She said she was going to get a member of Senior Management on the line. There was a brief pause. When she came back on the line, she said that they spoke senior management and also their supervisor. They reviewed my situation and said that the case will be reopened and that there will be a rush placed on this order. I asked her what the difference in timing would be when something is place on a rush status. She said that the Supervisor has 24 hours to look into this. She said she asked them if they could call XXXX direct and they said the system does not work that way. She said she would call me back on Monday to give me the results. Once again, she went on to explain that the XX/XX/XXXX payment shows as NOT being late. I will wait for the call. \\n\\n\\nCalled XX/XX/XXXX Spoke with the mortgage dept. I asked them if they had an update on my file. The person I spoke with an individual named XXXX ID XXXX to see what the status was on their end. I shared that I received an email from XXXX stating that my file had been updated. This was unfortunate because it is incorrect. She stated that it has been reported to XXXX that the file was correct. I asked her to read the letter that US Bank sent to me suggesting that both XXXX and XXXX were made on time. She found and read the letter agreeing with this fact. XXXX explained that US Bank has until the XXXX to finalize the work order. I asked when the last time was that US Bank spoke with XXXX. She indicated that it was around XX/XX/XXXX. I reminded her that I just received an email this morning indicating that my XXXX file had been updated. The update shows that XX/XX/XXXX is still reporting as being 30 days late. I told XXXX that I am thinking that the work order is actually complete and that the XXXX is only the date that US Bank is planning on getting back to me. I also told her that I believed that this will simply continue until I get a job at XXXX or US Bank and physically hit the delete key myself. I told her that my efforts to upload the letter with a US Bank letterhead to XXXX obviously did not work in my favor despite the fact that it states that XXXX and XXXX were current. I asked if XXXX was prohibited from allowing me to speak with a Supervisor. She indicated that she is not prohibited and put me on hold. At this point, 25 minutes had passed. XXXX came back on the line and said that she has a rep on the line and was just going over details with that person. Then XXXX came on the line. She said she is brought up to speed. She referenced the letter from the XXXX. She said that there is a lot of mis-communication going on and that the letter that was drafted was not clear. Our call got dropped somehow. It came back to XXXX and she worked to get XXXX back on the line. She also confirmed my cell if the call got dropped. XXXX was no longer available. A new person XXXX ID-XXXX, I mentioned to her that I have a Word document that goes all the way back to XX/XX/XXXX. He was confirming that they sent a letter on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX noting that XXXX was current. I let him know that XXXX is the main issue, not XXXX. I went on a long historical rant. XXXX now better understood what was up. He agreed that XXXX were correct. Please correct the credit report. He made these notes. I asked if there was a training issue with his team. He said that it would be a mis-interpretation. He said that he may have used his tools better to correct this issue. He said he can not rush this order. He said he tried in the past and it has gotten kicked back. He said he could issue a free-form letter that helps clear up this issue that I could send to the Credit Bureau myself. I said I would like that. He said it would be emailed and mailed to me. It is hoped that his new notes would improve the odds of this getting corrected at the credit bureau. Our conversation has now crossed the one-hour mark ending at XXXX. There are 3 orders open, - credit report correction, the letter, and a rush for the letter to be sent to me. We ended the call at XXXX XXXX.',\n",

Which again is not true. This issue wasn\\'t investigated and Wells Fargo is now charging me over {$14000.00} In Fraudulent Charges. I should not be responsible for Fraudulent charges when I reported this promptly and Wells Fargo Terms and Conditions state they have a ZERO LIABILITY GUARANTEE. However as you can see from the screenshots of my online banking. There were \" Several Bank Adjustments \\'\\' That were not charges not credits mind you. The Lady in the Claims Assistance Center didn\\'t care to hear what I had to say and told me they will escalate my complaint to the \" Executive Office \\'\\' Which again never heard anything back. I do not have an XXXX Account The Merchant is fraud, Nor Do I do business with a \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' Or XXXX Eats. All of these merchants are fraud and I don\\'t even have credentials to login to any of these because they were never my accounts. How can you charge someone fraudulent debt and expect them to pay fraudulent charges when it goes against your own policies and it wasn\\'t investigated either. I already told Wells Fargo I do not do business with these merchants and have not. Additionally one of the charges for a \" XXXX XXXX \\'\\' they sent a receipt that has no signature on it. Doesn\\'t look like my writing on the tip either. So again, Fraudster used it \" Yet wells fargo verified the charges \\'\\' Again. I do not believe I should be responsible for fraudulent charges that I promptly reported. These Charges are causing the credit lines to be over for both cards and it\\'s because of the uber charges, the favor charges, and the stub hub charges all which took place online that were not authorized.',\n",

I was paying faithfully, when I noticed in XXXX that the bank stopped taking my payments. I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX  and asked why they were not taking my payments anymore and they told me that they sold my loan to \" XXXX \\'\\'. I called XXXX and tried to make arrangements to continue paying. I sent several payments to XXXX and when I asked for my balance, I noticed the loan balance was not going down. I went on forbearance with XXXX in hopes I could get an accurate balance. \\n\\nMy personal information was accidentally released by my employer and a few weeks later I started to receive letters in the mail from no less than 6 different Collection agencies, requesting that I immediately pay each one of them for the student loan. I think my information was used and now scam artist are trying to solicit me and cheat me out of money.\\n\\nXXXX sold my loan to a company called \" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \\'\\' and they automatically said that I owed more money than I originally borrowed. Within a few months, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sold my account to XXXX. I received only ONE letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX  and they told me that \" Penalties and interest \\'\\' are being added every minute and my balance is way more than I borrowed originally ( {$4800.00} ). XXXX told me that they could not take any payments because they sold my account to a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX and they will ask for way more money. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX and asked if I could just repay what I owe to them. XXXX XXXX told me they can not accept any payment for loans. \\n\\nMy loan has been sold to so many different collection companies that I do not know who the real holder of my account is. I received advice to contact the Department of Education Ombudsman Program, so I filed several cases with them, requesting they look into this. To this date, the DOE Ombudsman has not made any contact with me at all. \\n\\nCurrently, I am talking with some legal aids on XXXX XXXX XXXX  and have had several helpful comments. They seem especially interested due to the fact that my student loan ( WHICH I PAID OFF IN FULL ) was handled by XXXX, the company that got sued for doing illegal and deceptive business practices. I was sent a letter that promised the credit bureaus would be notified within 90 days that this information would be permanently removed from my credit report. Obviously, it was not and now it has been used against me unjustly. \\n\\nSeveral years back, I PAID OFF my student loans IN FULL and received a CLEARANCE LETTER advising me that it was PAID IN FULL. \\n\\nIt was XX/XX/XXXX, I received a etter that promised the credit bureaus would be notified within 90 days that this Student Loan information would be permanently removed from my credit report. \\n\\nIt took everything I had to pay them off and I was relieved that the nightmare was finally over, or so I thought. You see, I originally had my Student Loan through XXXX XXXX ( YES the same wells fargo bank that got sued for deceptive business practices ). XXXX XXXX ( without notifying me ) sold my loan to another bank, who proceeded to sell bits and pieces of my loan to other collection agencies and banks. It took me years to track down each and every company that claimed I owed them a student loan. \\n\\nWell, imagine my surprise when I went to apply for a Parent Plus Loan to help my child get into College. Can you guess what information XXXX XXXX used ( from Transunion ) to deny my credit application? Transunion gave the specific reason as being defaulted loan which has been claim paid and XXXX XXXX  denied my application based on this erroneous derogative false entry in my credit. I was promised in writing that this information would be removed and it was not, resulting in a denial. \\n\\nConsidering all the deceptive business practices that were used against me, why is this PAID claim still on my record and being used against me? \\n\\nThank you,',\n",

This is an increase of over {$200000.00} from the previous year. \\n\\n3 ) The company did adjust my payment amount, however it only went down by {$20.00}. There is still an increase in my payment of {$49.00}. ( {$49.00} x 12 mths = and increase of {$590.00} annually. ) It can not be from my taxes, because my taxes from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX have only increased by {$69.00}, so it can't be from that. I don't know why they have charged me so much extra. \\n\\n4 ) Whenever I call this company to inquire about something, the hold time is sometimes an hour long. Then I get transferred everywhere without ever having a resolution to my problem. I'm often told different thing. I don't know what the first adjustment was for, but as mentioned was able to get about {$20.00} removed from the increase in payment. \\n\\n5 ) I decided to pay {$10000.00} on the principal in order to lower the amount so I could get the PMI payments of {$210.00} removed from the loan, but I'm 1 % shy of getting to the 80 % LTV. But when I contacted them requesting to have the PMI removed, I was sent correspondence telling me that I have to have my loan paid down to 75 % LTV before they can remove the PMI. I thought that the Homeowner 's Protection Act of 1998 said that there needed to 80 % Principal paid in order to have the PMI. Doesn't that still apply, or does each company make up their own rules for that act? \\n\\n6 ) How is the 80 % calculated? My purchase price was {$240000.00}, and my principal is {$200000.00}. According to my calculations, if I pay down another {$2600.00} on the principal, then I would be at 80 % ( XXXX=80 % ). Is this the right calculation for the 80 % to be satisfied? \\n\\n7 ) Another thing I have asked the company for is a copy of the declaration page for additional flood gap coverage on policy # FL {>= $1,000,000} that they have placed upon my condominium. They have never sent one. Doesn't the consumer have a right to get a copy of the declaration page for something that they are being charged for? \\n\\n8 ) The company also charged me a late payment of {$25.00} when I had made a payment over the phone on time, since the payment I had mailed in had not been applied by the deadline. This was during the time that the company was transferring over from one lender name to another, and I think they were back-logged so a lot of payments were probably not processed on time. This double payment withdrawing from my account caused my mailed payment to be rejected by the bank, and they charged me for it, even though I told them that by having to make a phone payment since my payment hadn't been applied, the one I mailed in I'd be placing a stop payment on it. They eventually did refund the {$25.00}, and this should not have caused a late payment on my account, since there never has been one late. \\n\\nI am very upset about this whole situation, the lack of good customer service, and I wonder how many other consumers besides myself have been affected by their payments going up by at least {$600.00} annually. This is not an ARM. I have a 3.875 % interest rate on my loan. There is no reason they should be allowed to get away with this.

After landing a job again and trying to get back into financial shape I reached out to settle my debt but Educap , Inc. was very predatory about it. They wanted 2X the loan amount even after several payments which reduced the actual amount. I felt it was unfair and agreed to the principal amount to make them whole and they disagreed. They then attempted to sue me twice in a state which I do not live ( Florida ) and continually degrade by credit rating every month. I have tried to reach out to settle the debt but never get a response. This company has no heart, no want or desire to fuel educational growth but to feed off people 's hard earned money to advance their greedy interests. Very shameful.\",\n",
       " \"Over past year I have numerous attempts to recertify my Mortgage Company 's ( Seterus ) reporting to the credit bureau. I have done what they have asked over the year to help facilitate my request but still no resolution. Each time I have called I been told something different as to what the problem was or what I needed to do to correct the issues. I was first told that all they needed to do was to turn on a flag on their system so that reporting would be done. When no correction I contacted them again as was told they would fix it. Again nothing so I called again I was then told that I needed to write a formal complaint to their office, which I did ( XXXX so I could not get a certified letter to them ) again no response. Called again and was told to contact the bureaus since on their end everything was ok. So I contacted the credit bureaus to file a dispute to which the agencies replied that they have contacted them and filed a dispute but they have not gotten any corrections from them. I again contacted Seterus and was told they would look into it and call me back in a day or so, after a week no repines so I contacted them again and again I was told to contact the credit bureaus which I did and was told that all they can do is report what they are given and if the servicer does not correctly report that I should contact them to resolve the issues. This goes on and on for over a year till I was told a month ago that their indeed was a problem on their end and they were not sure why and would look into it. However like normal no call back when I called to check and see why no one called me back and to check on status they told me that their main accounting department had the problem and had to do the reporting manually and that it would take upto a week to get it done so I should just sit and wait. So again I waited when again I called to check on status not only was the notes from the previous call not there they had an entirely different reason as to my call. So I then proceeded to go over my issues with the rep again and again was told that they would have to put in a XXXX XXXX XXXX report and just to sit and wait. Well as to be expected at this point nothing again. So I contacted them again and then was told to write them again and contact the bureaus when I told them that I have already done that and that not only have I been told by Seterus that they got the request by the credit reporting agency but they also had a problem with truing on the flag to report in their system. The rep then said all she could do is put in a request and I just have to sit and wait. I asked to speak to a supervisor and the supervisor then told me that they did n't have to report my payment if they did n't want to but if I make a late payment they would n't hesitate to report that. When I mentioned that they have reported in the past my payments she went silent, then said if I want anything corrected get the report from the agencies and send it in and they will look at it. I told her not only was there no reporting they have it down as me doing only partial payments which I am not. I have been current and on time for over a year and that I have done everything they have asked to get this corrected only now to find out a year down the road that not only did every rep lie to me the whole time I was given the run around. Not once was I ever told that they would never report any payments unless I was late. Not XXXX time even though they did in the past. She then said be on time and if I have a complaint to write them again. It seems this company wants their customers to fail their reps either lie or make up something to just get their customers off the phone, either to buy time or shut us up for a bit. Even if I want to reify with someone else I could n't because of non ( and Incorrect ) reporting and put me at a disadvantage to be able to do so.\",\n",

Also when I did listen to her message she just stated that she would like for me to call her. I believed that she was just calling to ask if everyone went ok with the wire transfer and if I had any questions. Never once during her message did she say that it was important that I call her. \\n\\nUpon arriving home are being gone for some time, I opened my mail and had a letter from Citi Bank stating that they were going to close my account after a recent review!

I decided after hanging up with that department I would head on over to the bank the next day. \\n\\nWhen I arrived at the bank the following morning I spoke with the account specialist that had helped me open the trust account. She stated that she had called me because the bank needed more information on the trust, and because they weren\\'t able to reach me they decided to close the account! I asked her why hadn\\'t she left in her message that the bank needed more information, or that it was very important that I call her back, as I thought she was just giving me a curtesy call. She couldn\\'t explain why! Just that she did call. At this point I didn\\'t want to go through the idle chatting, just wanted to know where my {$160000.00} was. She got on the phone and called her bank customer support, and explained that I was there and wanted to know what was going on with my funds! She didn\\'t get anymore answers than I did, just that it was sent to another dept and that they couldn\\'t give her any information on when the check would be mailed, or what had happened. She got off the phone and relayed this information to me. Again I was upset and demanded that I be cut a check from the bank that took my money. She stated that, that would not be possible and that she had no more information for me. I stated that Id need to contact a lawyer, and left the bank. \\n\\nWhen I got into my car I decided to call customer service again and ask to speak to a supervisor or someone else that could give me the answers that I needed.

She transferred me to the branch service support unit, but told me that if they didn\\'t answer Id need to leave a message because she couldn\\'t give me a direct number. I agreed and had to leave a message stating my phone number, name and reference number from the letter that Citibank had sent me. \\n\\nI then decided to make a call back to to bank and speak to the branch manager and explain to her what was going on and she if she would be of any help. The manager stated that she had heard a little about what was going on and let me explain the ordeal further.

About a week later I received a new Macy 's card with a statement that had all the fraudulent charges on it. I then called Macy 's and asked why they transferred all the fraud charges to a my new card. Their answer this is how they do it until the investigation is over and I am still not obligated to pay for the charges. I 'm still a little confused but ok at this point. Of course I did n't pay that bill so then I begin to get calls from Macy 's telling me about my large balance and that it is over due! I then call Macy 's and ask why they are calling me to pay. Also when I do call I wait on the phone for at least an hour while they look into matters. They again tell me it will take 90 days and this is what has to happen and they will stop the calls. They did not stop as I got several more calls and also more bills with interest and late fees! This is very upsetting as I pay all my bills on time and never carry a balance. So now it is 3 months later I have been dealing with this and they have reported me to the credit bureaus as being late/not paying my bill. Thus ruining my excellent credit! This is absolutely absurd because why should I be penalized for something I did n't do. They know it is fraud and they say I do n't have to pay the bill but they report me! What is that? Macy 's has greatly upset me and consumed my life the last 3 months because I have had to call them over and over again with no positive outcome. {$1500.00} was charged on my Macy 's credit card through Macy's.com and sent to a PO box which I know and Macy 's knows is fraud, but they still have to investigate. They can investigate all they want but leave me out of it as I have nothing to do with that. I 've done all I can do and I 'm not sure what else I can do before taking legal actions. Macy 's has really handled and is still handling my situation very poorly. I want them to clear up my credit and put everything back to the way it was before this mess began. I do n't know if that is even possible once you are reported to the credit bureaus to get it wiped off? So they may have ruined my credit which I will then take legal action for sure. When will this investigation be done and why add interest and late fees. That about sums up my fiasco with Macy 's.\",\n",

They were unable to assist me. They supervisor provided me another number, which was to a call center in Wisconsin, and the representative was very rude, uncaring and unhelpful. I hung up and I'm now back to CFPB to assist me in getting funds on this card. This has been the worst experience, and the number on the card really does not assist someone with a unique situation.

XXXX XXXX records show they sent the {$1500.00} payment via paper check through US Mail on XX/XX/XXXX. I was disappointed that these two mega banks could not find a way to transfer funds electronicaly to each other, but thought all would be fine because we still had 4-5 days until payment was due. Should be enough time for mail delivery and posting, or so I thought. \\n\\nUnfortunately, Capital One did not post payment until XX/XX/XXXX, a full 18 calendar days after I sent funds on line through XXXX XXXX. Either XXXX XXXX did not truly send funds on XX/XX/XXXX, the check got held up in the mail, or Capital One was very slow in posting payment. In the meantime, Capital One sent an update to credit reporting agencies that we were 60 days past due on payment. My FICO score dropped 41 points overnight as a result. We are looking to re-fi our home mortgage, and this dropped my score below 700. Now the lender we were working with is no longer willing to give us best rates. \\n\\nIn researching this issue with both XXXX and CapOne, we have learned that this has been a consistent issue for several months- payment takes up to three weeks to post ( I have dates from bank statements, confirmed by XXXX service ). By the way, XXXX XXXX service has been terrific. CapOne- not so much. My understanding is that XXXX has contacted CapOne to confirm to CapOne that they ( XXXX ) sent payment on XX/XX/XXXX. So, CapOne should be well aware that this is their error- not mine or XXXX XXXX . \\n\\nMy complaint is that CapOne seems to have sloppy operations where it takes them up to two works or more to post payment after they have evidently received it. Their neglect should NOT have a negative impact to my credit rating. XXXX XXXX has been great. I have made mutiple calls to CapOne and they say their is nothing they can do, other than to look into it again which will take an additional 60-90 days. They have alrady looked into it and sent me confirmation that eveything they have reported is accurate. I have very little confidence that they even understand my complaint- THAT IT TAKES THEM TWO WEEKS+ TO POST PAYMENT. They seem to be stuck on their actual posting date, and say all is accurate because the posting date is what was sent to reporting agencies. They keep missing my point that the whole issue is that they have had a check in hand for two weeks and they have failed to post it. Not my fault they have XXXX operations, but my credit rating has seen considerable damage as a result of their sloppiness.',\n",

She said the regular and business SPG card are considered the same and that she is not entitled to the bonus. She said on some cards and especially with the Platinum they are considered different products, but for this offer it is not. Has anyone been told this before?

Any suggestions are appreciated. \\n\\nencin Just followed up with amex on my missing spg biz points from when I met min spend on XXXX for the XXXX offer. This is the second case I opened with them, they decided to just close the first case with no apparent action. \\nThe CSR just mentioned that the second case which I opened on XXXX was closed on XXXX, and apparently they confirmed a glitch on their end that did n\\'t properly attach the sign-up promotion code to my account. They verified that I do qualify and that I should be receiving the points, but did n\\'t get give a timeline.

I was like how do I know they are n\\'t just going to close this in two weeks and keep telling me the same bs and I demanded something in return. I was hoping for more points but settled for XXXX - she was n\\'t willing to negotiate there mwwalk My wife got the XXXX business back when it was available for XXXX points. We hit the spend immediately and then never received any of the signup bonus points. In XXXX I chatted and they could see the points had not posted despite completing spend so they opened a ticket. I chatted again ever couple weeks and they could never do anything and were really annoying ( and lazy ). Today, the bonus points finally posted. Thank goodness. For those that will want to know, they never called or emailed to ask questions. A significant portion of the $ XXXX MSR was done with MS , probably about 65 % of it. But none of it at Level 3 data supplying stores and I put in a bunch of other smaller charges as well - genuinely used it for everyday spend except meals/travel. Several charges were {$500.00} from XXXX because I got lazy so it would be pretty obvious what they were, but did n\\'t seem to matter. Yay! If you \\'re still waiting, have hope. \\n\\nnetscooby I had signed up for the XXXX XXXX card with the XXXX bonus. After meeting the XXXX spend back in early XXXX with no MS and never having the card, I never received the bonus, not even the XXXX for the XXXX spend. A couple support calls and they finally sent my case to the mysterious back office a couple weeks ago. Follow up today and they stated that I \\'m still good and do qualify, but this is a \" Known issue \\'\\' for this card. \\nAnyone else experiencing this?

At that time, SLS did not have a legal and valid assignment to it prior to attempting to collect on our debt obligation in violation of California Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, hereinafter referred to as the Rosenthal Act, California Code of Civil Procedure, section 1788.13 ( l ).

Only creditors and/or their authorized agents may commence and complete a foreclosure in California. These are all violations under the Rosenthal Act, California Civil Code section 1788.13 and 1788.17.

       " 'Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs \\'\\', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.\\n\\nAlthough I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.\\n\\n1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.\\n\\n2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.\\n\\n3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.\\n\\n4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.\\n\\n5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.\\n\\n6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..',\n",

       " 'Approximately four months ago, my mortgage began being processed and handled by a company called PHH Mortgage Services, and I immediately began having trouble with with their payment services. \\n\\nI\\'ve had a mortgage for over eighteen years and I pay dozens of bills monthly, both by telephone and on the lenders websites. Although some are more user friendly than others, all are doable within five minutes or less. \\n\\nThat is not the case with PHH Mortgage Services. \\n\\nAfter spending several hours attempting to make my first payment to them on their website, I was unsuccessful and forced to call them. No matter when I called, hold times were always in excess of 30 minutes, and many calls were even placed on hold indefinitely. \\n\\nIf you were lucky enough to ever reach a human, there was a fee for paying with their assistance, yet there was no other \" simple \\'\\' method for paying. \\n\\nI searched online and I immediately found that I was not alone. Several dozen PHH customers are all over XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX reviews, with the same complaints as mine ; difficult or impossible to reach a customer service agent, gratuitous hold times, malfunctioning payment systems, inability to submit payments, excessive fees for making payments, and then excessive late fees, negative credit remarks, and penalties when the payments are not made on time. \\n\\nI continued to struggle making my monthly payments, because their phone system was so antiquated and poorly organized. Making additional payments to my principal was near impossible, and the average call length was 15 minutes to pay. \\n\\nThen, for the month of XXXX, 2019, PHH took my mortgage payment out of my account twice. This overdrew my checking account by XXXX XXXX dollars, and it caused me to incur overdraft fees, as well as then being unable to pay the rest of my creditors on time. \\n\\nIt took numerous phone calls to my other creditors and financial institution to correct this issue, and it was fifteen days before PHH returned my money. \\n\\nFinally, on XX/XX/2019, I attempted to pay my XXXX mortgage payment, using the automated phone system as I had always done before. \\n\\nThe automated phone system refused to accept my payment, and repeated attempts yielded the same results. After well over an hour, I called and sat on hold for another hour, before reaching a PHH customer service agent. \\n\\nThe agent tried several times to process my payment, and they were not able to do it either. They then told me that my financial institution was to blame, so I called my financial institution. \\n\\nMy bank told me that no one had made any attempts at submitting payments requests to my account, and that I had well more than sufficient funds to handle any request. \\n\\nI then called PHH back, but I sat on hold for hours, and I never was able to reach an agent. Having 4.5 hours invested in attempting to make a simple monthly mortgage payment, I gave up and decided to try again on Sunday. \\n\\nOn Sunday, XX/XX/2019, I called in around XXXX Eastern time, and all PHH phone numbers, had a pre-recorded message which announced that their phone systems were down due to unforeseen technical difficulties. I continued trying again throughout the day and they recording was the same. \\n\\nI then attempted to pay online, and that system refused my payments as well. \\n\\nNow having almost 6 hours invested in trying to pay my mortgage, I called in Monday XX/XX/XXXX and I got the same message that the system was down. \\n\\nI waited a few hours and then called back, the system was then working, but a message informs you that hold times are much longer than usual, and that you will not be able to reach a customer service agent in under 30 minutes. \\n\\nSince I\\'m now at work, I can not sit on hold for several hours again, as I did all weekend long. My mortgage payment is due today, and I believe that PHH has already assessed fees to my account. \\n\\nI simply wish to pay my mortgage now, and in the future, with reasonable ease. \\n\\nI also believe that PHH has intentionally set their system up this way, so that customers are forced to incur late fees, and that as a result, customers will simply choose one of PHH \\'s other payment methods, which as they inform you in their recordings \" are profitable to them because of their arrangements with the companies whom handle those payments \\'\\'. \\n\\nI have recorded my calls with them, as well as the \" system down \\'\\' messages.

       " 'Re : Citizens One Home Loans I have attempted to resolve a dispute with Citizens One Home Loans ( \" Citizens \\'\\' ) to no avail. Here \\'s the background of the dispute. We had an outstanding mortgage loan balance of {$30000.00} which we sent a check in XXXX that Citizens cashed on XXXX XXXX, 2016. I did n\\'t realize that there was interest charge in arrears which would have been from XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX. I ultimately agreed with interest charge for this period. The dispute involves Citizens trying to charge me interest on the full amount of {$30000.00} subsequent Citizens cashing my check on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Below is a list of activities that occurred : I called Citizens on XXXX/XXXX/16 to resolve the variance in dispute. The Service Representative said she would research the issue and call me back the next day with the correct payoff amount. I would have made the payment over the phone. \\n\\nI did n\\'t receive a return call and therefore spoke to another customer representative on XXXX/XXXX/16 who stated that they did n\\'t apply the check to the outstanding principal which violates Citizens policy which is \" Additional funds received, if not specified, will be applied first to outstanding fees then to your principal. \\'\\' See Citizens document attached to my letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2016. I stated that they should not charge interest past XXXX/XXXX/16. The rep indicated that \\'s the way they calculate interest. When I pushed back on the legality of this practice, the rep merely stated - we will continue to charge full daily interest of {$4.00} until the minor outstanding balance was received. \\n\\nI was then referred to the Office XXXX and tried numerous times to call the office to resolve the dispute without a return call. Therefore, I calculated the correct interest amount and remitted a cashier check in the amount of {$180.00} along with the attached letter. I also asked numerous times for a copy of regulations that allow interest to be charged on paid off debt. Of course, they have not sent that yet. \\n\\nCitizens in the meantime returned my check of {$30000.00}. Citizens then proceeded to have their collection department call me to collect on the delinquent payment and added another 30 days of interest to my bill. I was also informed that my {$180.00} check was being sent back. \\n\\nOn XXXX XXXX, 2016, I made the full payment request of {$30000.00} in protest requesting that the excess interest charges be remitted back to me. Attached is the letter I included with the payment in protest. I strongly believe I should n\\'t be penalized with additional interest and strong arm collection efforts, for Citizens inability to correctly apply my original check to my outstanding balance. \\n\\nI then received a notice today ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ) that my loan was in default for lack of payments for XXXX and XXXX. \\n\\nI do n\\'t believe Citizens practice is in conformance with regulations and it probably violates debt laws. I am requesting that your office investigate Citizens practice they have subjected me to and determine the appropriateness of the practice. Furthermore, an investigation should be conducted of other early paid off loans to determine if other consumers overpaid interest. \\n\\nI have an excellent credit rating and do n\\'t want Citizens to mess it up.

I applied for this credit card when I received a pre-approved application by mail from them around one year and 3 months ago. The Life Miles credit card was mailed to me after I mailed the credit card application to the address they provided me. I traveled to XXXX in order to work there almost at the same time they mailed me the credit card but for some reason I never received the credit card by mail and of course I was not able to activate it because I never received it. \\nI was offered a job in XXXX there and I traveled XXXX for work for one year and two months. When they mailed me the credit card application, they specified in the credit card application that the annual fee was free of charge. This was one of the reasons why I applied for the credit card. One of the reasons was that the annual fee was free of charge and also because I was getting some credit card benefits that were offered to me along with the credit card. I was planning to come back to NY to pick up my mail, pick up the credit card and activate it when I would be already back to The United States. \\nI left for overseas before the credit card arrived and I stayed in XXXX for more than one year but on XXXX XXXX my mother passed away from XXXX in the state of XXXX.

I found out they were charging me around {$250.00} Dollars including the {$65.00} Dollars annual fee plus interest and late fees. This is very unfair to me. \\nThey were charging me an annual fee without even notifying me and I never received any phone call or voice message from U.S. Bank customer service representatives to inform me that I had an overdue bill. They never sent me e-mail messages even they have my e-mail address to notify me about this.

       " 'Summary : Due to Navy Federal Credit Union not properly processing my paycheck protection program loan, I received a fraction of what was due. They said its too late now, but I\\'m hoping you can please help me. \\n\\nDetails : PPP Loan Nightmare ( almost {$4000.00} in forgivable loan not received ) The PPP has led me to hours of stressful work trying to understand it, but after those hours I applied through the Navy Federal Credit Union ( NFCU ). In doing so, I was entrusting the NFCU to approve whatever amount I was truly due, and disperse it. However, by the time I completed the application, funding wasnt available. Yet, a 2nd round of funding became available, and the loan was processed, but at an amount below what we were truly due. \\n\\nWe were sent documents numerous times, with issues including : 1. Signatures of both employees of our LLC were needed ( we were called about this after waiting a bit on getting documents sent to us ), and yet there was no opportunity to sign both, because they never sent the documents to my wife. \\n2. The next round of documents were signed, yet we were told they were incorrectly done, so we had to get another round of documents to sign. \\n3. Signatures were hurriedly completed, as it was feared the 2nd round of funding would be exhausted and no one at the time said we were secure w/the funding for our loan, especially considering the above issues created days of delays. And, if we can sign wrong documents and be able to sign correctly done documents for NFCUs sake/benefit, then we should be able to also get a 2nd chance to sign correct documents for our sake. \\nHere are the two ways in which the loan was not processed at the correct amount, according to the federal government ( IRS ) : I. According to https : //home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/How-to-Calculate-Loan-Amounts.pdf? utm_medium=email & utm_source=govdelivery, under \" 5.Question : \\'\\', it says, \" plus any pre-tax employee contributions for health insurance or other fringe benefits excluded from Taxable Medicare wages & tips \\'\\', and dependent care is a fringe benefit that is excluded from taxable XXXX wages & tips. The following link shows where the IRS describes dependent care as a fringe benefit and as exempt from said taxation : https : //www.irs.gov/publications/p15b See \" Table 2-1. \", which lists it as a \" fringe benefit \\'\\' and then how it is exempt from said taxation [ if under {$5000.00} ]. \\nTherefore, on the W3 & W2 forms submitted to NFCU, the amount spent in payroll for dependent care, {$4100.00}, should have been applied. \\nII. The FAQ says : \" 2019 employer retirement contributions \\'\\' shall be included calculation. These appeared on my 1120S tax return, which was either not requested by NFCU for documentation, or somehow not received. \\n\\nIf there were any documents submitted that appeared as blank/unaccepted ( one person at NFCU said, after the loan was dispersed, they had a document they couldnt read because form fields appeared blank, and I was told screenshots of documents were not accepted, too ), I should have been informed before anything was [ ordinarily ] irreversible. Any good credit union works with members to ensure the members get the best benefit, not rush through it and gyp the member, and I think NFCU may be good under normal circumstances, but this time we had a situation where if the documents were not accepted, or any were missing, I should have been told 1st. And, it was clearly NFCUs error to have not included the dependent care benefits that were supposed to have been included, and were on a form that was received and accepted. \\n\\nI\\'ve had a long history with NFCU, so I\\'ve been quick to trust in any procedures done there. I do realize this is a new program, and NFCU is trying to get through a lot of applications, but I believe my small other local credit union would have let me know if any issues, corrected issues, and gotten me the maximum loan that the FAQ you sent me explains. Nevertheless, I hope theres a solution that can be found to correct this situation.',\n",

I am a current safety box ( Signature Card Holder ) at branch that cashed check. Please ask XXXX that she can verify my signature on file and she knows me as I am a former employee. Is this the way you treat ALL former employees of the bank? \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2019, I went to the local branch of Union Bank or MUFG Union Bank and wanted to cash a check written to me from my mom ( Check Number XXXX in the amount of {$760.00} was drawn on Union Bank ). I went to the teller window and was asked for 2 pieces of Identification. I had that and provided it. Next, they asked me for ID to cash my mom 's check. I was shocked at the request and had the employee ask XXXX ( Customer Service Manager ) if I still had to give the fingerprint even if she can vouch for me as a her former employee. According to her, I was required to provide the fingerprint. It hurt me that they did not trust me cashing my own mother 's check. \\n\\nTrust is very important and I did nothing wrong for them to treat me less than equal to other former employees. Also, due to the new smartphone technologies, fingerprints are now more a security or privacy risk and can be a possible violation of 4th amendment rights. The use of fingerprints as unlock feature can pose as this risk and the bank should protect consumers, as well as, find new ways to secure assets. No one believes me. \\n\\nI previous complaint was filed with the CFPB and hope this can be resolved correctly. Can you please ask XXXX XXXX why I am unable to bank with my family at Union Bank or MUFG Union Bank and to avoid these type of check cashing issues in the future? \\n\\nRespectfully submitted for review.\",\n",

All the resources say to check our Wells Fargo bank account for unusual activity. But the problem is we are no longer a Wells Fargo customer, because of their unusual and seemingly illegal activities on our bank account, we changed banks several years ago. I contacted Wells Fargo to complain about their practice of taking funds out of our checking account several days prior to the authorized date, causing our account at times to be overdrawn. Especially when they took our mortgage payment out 3-5 days prior to sending it to the mortgage company. I asked repeatedly what were they doing with our money during that period, were they investing it to make money off of it? They gave me all kinds of vague answers saying it was perfectly legal and they wanted to ensure I would have the funds available and this was their way of ensuring that. After months of frustration and unable to stop them from taking our money out of our account unauthorized, first we stopped using their online banking to authorize certain large payments, then we just changed banks. But I believe strongly that the money they were deducting from our account may have been used to set up unauthorized accounts. Can someone assist me with how to research this since I no longer even have an account with them, and we did not have paper statements from them from that time period? Thank you!\",\n",

Not to mention that I am shopping for a property and my credit is pulled by lenders who see a wrong inflated balance. \\nI am beyond frustrated with Discover Card, a company I thought was professional and had good controls regarding balance transfers. Every time I called, it was the same process. The main contact would transfer me to billing ( after keeping me on the phone for about 30 minutes ), then the billing admin would transfer me to a supervisor who would tell me after 45 minutes that they will need to further investigate. How much further investigation is necessary for a credit card leader such as Discover? I am a XXXX and to me it is very obvious : beginning balance + purchases - payments = the balance that I owe for the XXXX statement. However, Discover thinks the following formula is true : beginning balance + purchases - payments + purchases again = ending balance. \\nI really hope you can help me at this point because I really do not know what to do. Maybe actually showing up at their billing center and fixing the problem myself might be best? Please call or mail them a letter. They need to go ahead and not rob me of {$1000.00}. I am a single mom and am on a tight budget. This is what I call - taking advantage of the customer and I really do not appreciate it. \\nPlease call me with any questions as far as if you need further details about my situation.

       " \"Back in XX/XX/XXXX my wife and I had to file bankruptcy. At that time my mortgage company ( XXXX ) and my Lawyer advised us to re-mortgage our home. The mortgage was explained as a 30 mortgage with paying the bulk of the interest up front as interest only for the 1st 7 years then switching to a principal/interest loan for the last 23 years to pay off our house, because the bank was taking a larger risk with refinancing to us with the bankruptcy. We figured no big deal due to the fact interest has to be paid regardless and we'd be paying most up front. Fast forward to present time, My mortgage has since been sold to Fay Servicing. I've paid the 7 years interest only but now they are still taking almost {$1000.00} for interest and only {$60.00} for Principal. I called to find out whats going on and was told that its an interest only loan and whatever isn't paid off in 30 years I'll owe that money still. I've been paying a bi-weekly until XX/XX/XXXX and my mortgage has come down {$22000.00} in almost 13 years of paying on it and {$19000.00} out of that {$22000.00} came from my extra payment a year.

I still owe {$220000.00} and id need to pay {$1000.00} towards principal and {$0.00} towards interest to pay off my house in time.

He clearly stated falsely that I was lying on the application. \\nThis constitutes two counts by authorized PNC Bank Representative XXXX XXXX of committing the civil infraction of libel against me and was a defamation of my good character, while XXXX XXXX represented PNC Bank, NA, which bears direct responsibility for his illegal and upsetting acts which are personally injurious to me causing great distress to my well-being since my victimization by XXXX XXXX as he spoke for PNC Bank. \\nHaving been the victim of age discrimination I cant help but wonder if PNC Bank encourages bullying of older folks like me. My date of birth was required on my application. I am in the process of discussing this possibility with a legal firm expert in matters of age discrimination. \\nI contacted PNC Bank Representative XXXX merely to point out an error ON HIS PART that was delaying processing of my application. I was understandably upset at being called a liar and a felon and I demanded to speak with his supervisor at once. \\nXXXX XXXX TWICE REFUSED TO TRANSFER ME TO A SUPERVISOR but upon my insistence finally did so. \\nThe PNC Bank supervisor ( name, full title, and NMLS ID available on request ) heard my complaint and promised me that the recording of this call would be saved indefinitely. \\nIn an email time stamped XXXX CST on XX/XX/XXXX I received an admission of PNC Bank error : and an apology and excerpted below, full text available on request : In regards to your complaints from the interactions on your call this morning.I did review the call and again apologize any inference taken from the statements made. we are again moving forward with the application. .and again please accept my apology for any misunderstanding. \\nI have been contacted by a PNC investigator and will pursue this matter until I receive verification that XXXX XXXX has been subject to disciplinary action by PNC Bank, not excluding suspension or termination of his employment. Anything less will serve as solid proof that PNC Bank approves of, condones, and encourages XXXX XXXX illegal and outrageous behavior. \\nThis would surely indicate a more embedded culture of complicity by PNC Bank in areas that might uncover a XXXX XXXX corruption scenario that demands investigation by federal banking and justice authorities and in turn, the news media. Questions should be asked regarding how far up in the executive chain this might go. Like at XXXX XXXX, are instructions to Is the instruction to intimidate PNC Bank customers coming from PNC Bank CEO XXXX XXXX? \\nIt will be interesting to see whether my loan is approved since PNC Bank already erroneously ended consideration of it on faulty data recklessly submitted by its authorized representative, XXXX XXXX. That is until I corrected them and demanded my rights. I will certainly demand thorough investigation and audit by regulating authorities for even the slightest irregularities if it is denied.',\n",

My insurance company performed estimates for repairs and I selected my contractors to complete the repairs. Flagstar was listed on my insurance checks and needs to sign them before I can deposit them to pay my contractors. To get the checks signed the bank requested several documents along with the endorsed checks. One of the documents they are requesting is a XXXX from my contractor. My contractors and I do n't see the bank 's need for this document as the bank is not making payments to them but rather just endorsing the checks so I can receive funds to cover the repairs. Four checks have been issued so far. The first was for {$14000.00}, Flagstar endorsed this check and returned it. The other three checks the bank requested : XXXX, repair proposal, Borrower Affidavit, lien waiver from contractors, proof of insurance and licensing. I was able to secure lien waivers from all the contractors, which are conditional on the checks clearing but the bank wants unconditional waivers which is not possible since the contractor wants to guarantee they receive the payment in full. The process of securing these documents took a long while as my contractors stated it was not a usual process, I have had contractors decline the work due to the excessive paperwork requested by my bank. From speaking to several employees, I was given different stories. I was told if I could n't provide XXXX 's I needed the waivers other times they wanted all the documents. Currently, three checks are with the bank. I sent in documentation showing I have paid the first contractor {$6800.00} in full and a completion certificate. The bank is still withholding the checks received recently with a whole packet of necessary documentation. Today the bank emailed me and they want to perform an inspection of the work completion and then release funds but I need to pay my contractor the initial funds to cover materials. The bank refuses to send an inspector to verify the completed work and wants all work completed before any inspection. I can not move forward while they hold my insurance funds hostage.  They amount of documentation requested is more than standard and has a negative effect on me as the home owner. Winter is almost here and if it snows, my tarp will not hold and additional damage will occur to my interior space which I will hold Flagstar responsible as it is their delay that lead to this point. All I want to do is repair my house. I welcome their inspection but they have to at least release funds for materials. From the initial check I have a little over {$8000.00} which is n't close to half the cost, the roof alone was {$9000.00} before the porch, deck, gutters, window etc. The bank 's policy has a negative impact on my ability to complete repairs on time to solve this whole issue. I do n't have over {$25000.00} sitting around to pay the contractor and wait on the bank to reimburse me which is what they have suggested as a work around. I have had mortgages before and this is by far the most difficult bank policies I have dealt with on release of insurance funds for repairs. I have signed affidavit 's that repairs will be done, my mortgage is current, evidence of repairs being done is available and still they delay the process costing me time and money. My energy bills are sky high as the trap offers no insulation from heat let a lone the cold winter weather on its way. The bank 's policies are strictly to favor the bank at the expense of good consumers. I have had several discussions on this with employees and managers and nothing has improved or changed. Nobody deserve this kind of treatment when I have n't given them reason to doubt my character. My mortgage loan will be transferred as soon as this fiasco is resolved.

The documentation provided by the Merchant or reviewed during the investigation verified that you authorized the transaction ( s ). We will debit the provisional credit amount previously applied to your account for this claim, which includes the Disputed Transaction amount ( s ) ... on XX/XX/2021 .... \\'\\' My complaint is that I did not receive my purchase order, the merchant kept giving me excuses about the delay of my package \\'s shipment, the shipment was marked delivered to an unknown address, and the merchant refuses to issue me a full refund. Of course the transaction was authorized -- with the anticipation that I would receive my order. Not only that, but the merchant deducted the funds from my account BEFORE the order was allegedly shipped which was three weeks from the date of the debit transaction. According to the tracking status, my package was marked delivered to an unknown address via an unknown shipping carrier.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that I didn\\'t receive my order from the merchant, the merchant refuses to issue a refund, and Santander Bank has informed me that they will reverse the provisional credit based on their so-called investigation. \\n\\nI regret not doing research on XXXX prior to placing an order with them. This unfortunate experience has prompted me to review other customers \\' experiences with XXXX ; I\\'ve found thousands of negative reviews about this fraudulent business. One trusted website that you will find many complaints about XXXX can be reviewed via the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) website. I\\'ve been advised to file a report against XXXX with the Federal Trade Commission as well.',\n",
       " \"I have had numerous issues with XXXX. This particular issue is that as I am working to rebuild my credit following a bankruptcy, I have an auto loan that I had prior to filing my Chapter XXXX bankruptcy. I reaffirmed the debt and had to dispute with XXXX that the amount was n't in bankruptcy. After that was finally resolved, they continue to report that my account is closed. I have disputed this no less than five times, online, by phone and in writing. This is a company whose sole purpose is to fairly report credit and they had done absolutely nothing to confirm that my account is open and current or they would have accurately reported it. XXXX does n't seem to do any due diligence in trying to accurately report credit for consumers. Moreover, they have reported payments being made after my account was allegedly closed ( because it is still an open account ). This is just one of the recent problems I have had with Transunion. This is important to me as I am rebuilding my credit and having an open, current car payment loan is good for me and hopefully my next car loan wo n't be at 12 % interest when current interest rates are 3-4 %.\",\n",
       " 'We purchased our home in XXXX XXXX for {$420000.00}. We financed {$350000.00} ( 5.875 % interest rate - 30 yrs fixed ). From XXXX XXXX to mid XXXX, we made regular payments on the loan ; but due to salary cuts, the failing economy, and other life changing events in mid XXXX, we began falling behind. We were 3 payments late when we tried to obtain a loan modification. At first, XXXX told us that we did not qualify for a modification because we were n\\'t significantly late on payments. They told us we had to stop making payments to qualify. We stopped making payments and continuously tried to obtain a modification. After 3 different \" trial payment plans, \\'\\' on XXXX XXXX, we received a letter from XXXX stating that we did not quality for a modification because our income-to-debt ratio did not satisfy their criteria. We were now 14 months behind on payments. The account was transferred over to Nationstar in XXXX. We received a letter from them stating that we were past due in the amount of {$89000.00}. They put us on another trial plan and we began making payments on XXXX XXXX. We made 13 trial payments from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX ( despite being told that the trial period would last only 3 months ), before we received our modification approval on XXXX XXXX. At the end of that year, the XXXX we received from Nationstar stated that our end-of-year balance for this mortgage was {$290000.00}. \\nThe terms of the modification were stated as follows : The new amount payable under the note would be {$390000.00}, including all unpaid amounts. {$290000.00} would be interest-bearing and {$94000.00} ( non-interest-bearing ) would be deferred to the end of a 40-yr fixed mtg at 4.625 %. NEW/UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE. Any past due amounts as of the end of the trial period, including unpaid interest, real estate taxes, insurance premiums, and certain assessments paid on your behalf to a third party, will be added to your mortgage loan balance. If you fulfill the terms of the trial period including, but not limited to, making any remaining trial period payments, we will waive ALL late charges that have accrued and remain unpaid at the end of the trial period. \\nAlthough this huge increase in the note should have raised our suspicion at the time, a combination of XXXX and misleading information from Nationstar led us to sign this modification as it was. \\nBecause we knew several people who had obtained principal adjustment loan modifications at the time and we had no detailed explanation from Nationstar, we understood that this clause meant that ALL unpaid late amounts would be waived, leaving us with the approximate original {$290000.00} unpaid principal figure after the modification. Furthermore, each year ( from XXXX-present ) we received a XXXX from Nationstar stating that our remaining principal balance was under {$290000.00}. Until present, when we log into the Nationstar website to pay our mortgage, there is a bold section that states that our principal unpaid balance is currently {$280000.00} and that we have over {$100000.00} equity in the home. We \\'ve been making consistent, timely payments since the modification. \\nIt was n\\'t until last month, when we applied for a refinance, that we noticed the discrepancy with what we thought we still owed - and what the Nationstar website led us to believe - and the actual payoff amount. We requested a loan payoff quote from Nationstar, which showed that our unpaid principal balance was just over {$370000.00}, consisting of {$280000.00} unpaid principal balance and {$94000.00} in lender paid expenses. \\nWe feel that they intentionally misled us into a loan modification that only benefited them, the lenders. Now, instead of owing {$280000.00} on 18 remaining years of a 30 year mortgage, we owe {$370000.00} on 35 remaining years of a 40 year mortgage.',\n",

He continued to be loud and argumentative. He then indicated that he was marking my account as refusal to pay ( even though I have not refused to pay ).

He indicated he was going to review the call recordings, speak with quality assurance and take the proper steps to rectify the situation as well as request a validation of the debt. He was to get back with me regarding the situation, but no call or letter was received to this effect. \\n\\nFast forward to today, I get a call from another bill collector ( same company ) and he indicates there are no notes about this previous call having issues, no request for quality assurance to review and no indication that I made claims of FDCPA violations. I request to speak to his supervisor to verify this information and I spoke with XXXX who was very nice, but did indicate the only thing notated was that i requested a bill from them. He indicated he was going to take action on this, but still tried to collect the balance on the bill. I know they need to ask, I worked in collections for 10 years. It just seemed slightly inappropriate given the circumstances of why I was speaking with him. \\n\\nThinking further, they also did not do anything to truly verify I was who they were looking for.

       " 'REQUEST FOR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORT!!! \\nI believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. The Act first established XX/XX/2003 was intended to establish a plan whereas common American citizens could obtain a copy of their credit reports at least once a year free of charge. Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as Free Annual Credit Report, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary. Even though I may have received an approval of an updated credit report from either Experian, XXXX XXXX or XXXX respectively, it is unfair that I need to do a mail request since I can submit my personal information through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) portal.

       " \"My husband and I jointly owned a home together with a mortgage through USAA. As part of an agreement, I signed over my interest in the home to my husband and he was to re-finance the home in his name alone and hold me harmless from the mortgage. As I was XXXX military, I signed a specific power of attorney to enable my husband to re-finance the home in his name alone at the time I deeded my interest in the home to him. Instead of refinancing the home in his name in my absence, he refinanced the home through USAA in his name as primary borrower but also signed my name through the power of attorney as secondary borrower. My signature was listed and signed by him as power of attorney. USAA knew the deed was in my husband 's name alone as it was an exhibit to the refinance mortgage, but they never contacted me to verify whether it was my intentions to allow my husband to co-sign my name to a mortgage refinance in which I held no interest in the property. Also, I never received a copy of the mortgage from USAA. Subsequently my husband began the process to correct the situation by filing an assumption request for mortgage through USAA in his name alone on or about XXXX 2015. USAA acknowledged the receipt of my husband 's request to assume the mortgage and sent the attached letter on XXXX XXXX, 2015. After submitting the request to assume the mortgage in his name alone, my husband suddenly passed away on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I was the initial administrator of my deceased husband 's estate and I found the letter concerning assumption and immediately contacted USAA who notified me to send in the information they had requested from my husband and they would process the assumption as my husband had requested. I sent the requested information on or around late XXXX 2015. Instead of processing the assumption in the name of my husband estate per his initial request, USAA own its own removed my husband name who was the primary borrower off the mortgage which essentially left me as the only borrower for a property I no longer owned. I immediately notified USAA of the error, but it took several weeks and many calls and letters before USAA even returned the designation on the mortgage back to its original status by listing my husband 's estate as primary borrower. They however left my name as co-borrower despite the assumption request my husband had submitted before he passed way. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, my husband 's son presented my husband 's will to probate and was appointed executor. I immediately notified USAA that I was no longer administrator and provided the Probate Courts Contact Information and Executors contact information to file a claim for payment of a claim with Probate Court. Around XXXX XXXX, USAA removed the mortgage information from my USAA account online and ceased corresponding with me concerning the account. I assumed USAA was properly pursing the matter in Probate Court. Thereafter on XXXX XXXX with no prior notice, USAA reported a 2 month delinquency on the mortgage payments to the credit bureaus under my name which lowered my credit score from XXXX to XXXX. At the same time the mortgage information that had been removed from my USAA online account for approximately XXXX weeks was reposted. I immediately contacted USAA again and they admitted they dropped the ball in handling this matter, but to my knowledge they have not corrected the situation. Today I followed up with USAA and was told that they were not filing the claim with probate court and that since my husband signed my name as co-signer they were pursuing me for payment without first trying to collect from the Estate as primary borrower. I can not make the mortgage payments and do not want the house to go to foreclosure. The Estate has the funds to make the mortgage payments and satisfy the mortgage in its entirety, but USAA refuses to file the claim.\",\n",
       " 'A bankruptcy was filed while mortgage was on a biweekly accelerated mortgage program. I was already ahead on my mortgage payments when bankruptcy was filed. The company ceased collecting but failed to report that to me and failed to inform me of options to continue payments. The company revoked my online access during the bankruptcy removing my ability to pay electronically after removing my automated drafts. While I now understand why the drafts had to stop ; I feel they owed me a notice of some sort with explanation what could and would happen to my mortgage while the bankruptcy proceedings went on and detailing how I could proceed with making payments on a voluntary basis. They also removed the option to use the automated phone system to pay my monthly mortgage nearly setting me up for default. \\n\\nAt the recommendation of my attorney I was able to call in to speak to a representative to explain why I needed to continue my mortgage payments. I was told the only way to pay is to call in each month and wait for a representative to take it by phone. This was an unnecessary added stress and hassle. Each time I call in I have to wait on hold for unreasonable amounts of time some times as long as 45 minutes. \\n\\nI also verbally requested my mortgage be affirmed for bankruptcy making it very clear I intend to keep my home of 15 years. They failed to affirm my mortgage. They repeatedly told me they never got the request although it was faxed to the number they provided multiple times by myself and my attorney as well as mailed to them with formal service. Because they failed, my attorney filed a motion for the affirmation which went unanswered. They denied my legal protection by failing to take appropriate action and gave no explanation why they will not provide affirmation. \\n\\nTo date, the bankruptcy is complete and discharged without protection of the mortgage affirmation or response of any sort from the mortgage company leaving me in a legal risk. \\n\\nNow that the bankruptcy discharged, I was given instructions how to print a biweekly form to resume my mortgage drafts. They refused to mail or email the form to me. They would not provide me an email address or fax number requiring I mail it in. There\\'s no option to upload it to their website. I promptly followed their instructions. \\n\\nI\\'ve made multiple phone calls, sent messages through their online portal, and tried communicating with them through the click to chat feature when I\\'m logged into my account online. Their online chat option is never available when I attempt that even during their normal business hours. It doesn\\'t matter what time of day I try whether it be first thing in the morning, during lunch, mid -afternoon, or evening hours. \\n\\nEach time I have to call ( which has been regularly since XXXX ) I am waiting for a representative to assist no less than 30 minutes. When I do get a representative only two reps have actually been helpful over the multitude of calls I\\'ve made dating back to at least XXXX. One representative was able to explain why they stopped the draft. The other was able to confirm the authorization to resume was received in time to take action but they took no action. They also could not explain why they took no action. The authorization for the biweekly program with a voided check was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe representative I spoke to XX/XX/XXXX confirmed it was received on XX/XX/XXXX but they have failed to process it. The representative told me they can\\'t use the paperwork submitted in XXXX because it tells them to start in XXXX and they failed to start it. They tell me not to leave the start date blank on the new form because they can\\'t process it if it\\'s blank but they also won\\'t process it when it isn\\'t blank. They refuse to have someone from that department call me back stating they will send a request for call back because I am demanding it but they will \" almost guarantee \\'\\' it is not going to result in a call back because that team doesn\\'t call back. That I have to just take my chances submitting all new documentation and another payment. \\n\\nMy electronic messages are answered after days go by but they do not attempt to answer or resolve the problem. Instead they replied that they can see I called in and no longer need assistance which is completely false. I do still need assistance. The problem is not resolved. \\n\\nWith today \\'s technology it\\'s mind boggling that it should take 3 weeks from time of contact requesting XXXX drafting and forms mailed off to the time of completion. The company is clearly understaffed. One can only conclude they do not care about their fiduciary duty to paying customers and blatantly ignored the documentation that was submitted both timely and correctly. I have asked for quicker routes to get the paperwork done but there is none. \\n\\nI later received a notice stating they will draft my mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX but they did not process it. Then I got a letter once again stating they will not start the draft because payment is needed so I promptly submitted payment and another online email advising the draft should resume. \\n\\nI got a letter stating they tried to call me with no response but my phone records support they have not. Additionally I have zero voicemails. This affirms a prior rep \\'s caution advising me he will give the message but know I will not get a call back to resolve this issue. \\n\\nIt feels like they are purposely disregarding their duty to service my loan.

However, the credit bureaus do not follow through with any methodology a system that automatically removes an antiquated credit trade line, which leave creditors in control to remove a negative trade line at a later date by simply re-aging the trade line payment history. \\nNotice that a positive trade line can be maintained for a ten year timeline from the credit procurement after the account has been closed out. The ten year timeline carries from the date the credit trade line was first reported to a credit reporting agency, or from the date of procurement of the debt. \\nI demand the above referenced credit trade line removal based upon the passing of the XXXX year timeline. And I maintain that there is no further relevancy to the debt being posted under FCRA guidelines.

       " \"Summary of complaint : -Navient makes loan re-payment unnecessarily complicated and onerous for overseas borrowers in order to maximize their profits and penalize borrowers. \\n\\n-XX/XX/XXXX, Navient changed their card payment processing system without notifying borrowers. Their system now registers all overseas debit cards as credit cards. Credit cards are unable to be used for making repayments. They did this without notifying overseas borrowers who were the most likely to be negatively affected. I would like to lodge a complaint regarding the lack of notification about this significant change and how it has removed my ability to make loan repayments. \\n\\n-Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I made 6 expensive overseas calls to Navient to try to make payments for those months with a debit card from an overseas bank account. I was given false information by supervisors and employees that wasted my time and resulted in no payment ever being processed. I would like to lodge a complaint against these Navient supervisors and employees for jeopardizing my credit history. \\n\\n-During some of these phone calls, I was told the only options for loan repayment for overseas borrowers were now checks and money orders, both of which are costly, time consuming, and inconvenient. I would like to lodge a complaint against Navient about the limited options for loan repayment for overseas borrowers. \\n\\n-I have now been forced to take forbearance despite having both the money and desire to make payments. I would like to lodge a complaint against Navient for not being told about this option until the 6th phone call. I would also like to lodge a complaint against Navient for being forced into this decision in order to avoid negatively affecting my credit history, through no fault of my own, and because of changes with Navients ' card payment processing system. \\n\\nFull complaint : I took out a US DoE loan to obtain a XXXX 's degree from XXXX University of XXXX ( in XXXX XXXX ). My loan was sold to Navient for servicing after I completed my XXXX 's degree.I still live in XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nNavient makes it absurdly challenging for overseas borrowers to make repayments. We can not pay in advance or pay off large chunks of our loan from overseas bank accounts ( we can only may the amount due each month ). We also can not pay our loan online from overseas bank accounts. Both of those options are only available to US bank account holders. \\n\\nIn early XX/XX/XXXX, I began making my loan repayments using my debit card from my overseas bank account in XXXX XXXX. I rang Navient every month, or every few months, to make a payment using the same debit card. This always incurred a hefty phone bill, but it was the only time effective way to make payments without too much hassle. The payments were always processed. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX, Navient changed their card payment processing system. Their new system now registers debit cards from overseas bank accounts as credit cards. They did this without notifying overseas loan borrowers who would be adversely affected by the change. \\n\\nI rang Navient XX/XX/XXXX to make my payment for the month using the same debit card I have used since early XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with a woman who processed my debit card payment and said it went through. She said my confirmation of payment would be emailed to me. The whole phone call took about an hour because of wait times and repeated attempts to process the payment. I never received the email confirmation, but forgot about it over the XXXX holiday period. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Navient saying my account was overdue. I called Navient early XX/XX/XXXX to try to make another payment using the same debit card. It would not work. \\n\\nI called Navient again XX/XX/XXXX to try making payment using a different debit card. It would not work and I was told it was because the debit card was registering as a credit card on their system. I asked to speak with a supervisor. I was connected with a man named XXXX. He explained the change in card payment processing system may be the reason why my debit cards are registering as credit cards. He instructed me to go to my bank and get a verified letter stating my debit card was not a credit card. He instructed me to then load it up to Upload.Navient.Com. He advised a technical team would review the letter and then ( if approved ) change my card so it appeared as a debit card on their system. XXXX said it would take about a week or so and he would call me back with an update.The whole phone call took over an hour. \\n\\nI went to my bank, obtained the letter, and uploaded it to the website as instructed by the Navient supervisor, XXXX. XXXX never called me back. I received no email updates. \\n\\nI called Navient again on XX/XX/XXXX to follow up about the debit card. I spoke with two people who disconnected the call when I asked to speak with a supervisor regarding the problem. I then made several additional calls, but the Navient automated system kept terminating my call due to high call volume. Eventually, I got through to a third person, XXXX ( I believe ), who told me that the document I uploaded had not been received ( nor processed ) and that it was actually impossible to change how a debit card registered in the system as a credit card. XXXX said the only option available to me now for loan repayment was check or money order. I complained that was neither convenient nor cost effective, as money orders are prohibitively expensive and to get one every month was an unfair financial burden. I asked to speak with his supervisor. \\n\\nI was connected to XXXX, Navient employee ID XXXX. She also confirmed my uploaded document had not been received, but also would not have changed how my debit card was registered. She confirmed there was no way to make a payment using a debit card while overseas. She confirmed my options for repayment were check and money order. \\n\\nTherefore, I was misled by the Navient supervisor, XXXX, about my options for repayment, which wasted my time and energy. It also contributed to several weeks of not being able to make my loan repayment, potentially jeoaprdising my credit history. This delay and time wastage was in addition to the previous Navient employees who also fed me incorrect information, did not understand how to process payments, and were unable to correctly identify the problem or propose a working solution. They all have caused me to be 55 days overdue for payments, despite repeated attempts and having more than enough funds. \\n\\nWhen I expressed concern to XXXX at Navient that the time it would take to send and process payments made via money order would mean my credit history was negatively affected, she was the first person to offer forbearance as an alternative. It took speaking to 6 people to be given that as an option. Why did none of the previous supervisors and employees offer that as a solution? \\n\\nAs I literally had no other option for making loan repayments while overseas, I have been forced to go into forbearance despite having the money to make my monthly payments. This will negatively affect my loan in the long-term as my interest accrued during forbearance will get added to my principal. This is unfair, but I have not other option. \\n\\nTo summarize, I would like to lodge complaints against Navient for : 1. Changing their card payment processing system without notifying borrowers, in advance.\\n\\n2. Having a new card payment processing system that incorrectly registers all overseas debit cards as credit cards.\\n\\n3. Removing options for loan repayment while overseas that are reasonable for borrowers ( payment online, payment over the phone via debit card, payment in advance ) and only allowing slow, costly, and inconvenient repayment options that benefit Navient ( monthly payment for the amount due via check or money order only ).\\n4. Having an employee who incorrectly claim she processed a payment, only to find out several weeks later that the payment didn't go through.\\n\\n5. Having a supervisor lie and mislead customers about the processes and options for repayments.\\n\\n6. Taking 6 phones for someone to offer a potential solution of a forbearance. 7. Removing all reasonable options for repayment so that overseas borrowers are forced into\\nchoosing forbearance, despite having the desire and funds to make payments. This should be criminal.\",\n",

This was followed by Fay deciding to force place their own hazard insurance on the property, which was significantly more expensive than the policy I had in place.

I have tried to fix this situation with Fay but have made no progress. \\n\\nI bought this house with my wife back in XXXX. We refinanced the home in XXXX and the loan ended up going to XXXX.

However, she did not make ANY payments toward the home ( I did not know this because the mail did not come to my address ). After a couple of years I found out that my wife, kids and in laws had moved out and abandoned the house. I fought for several months to finally get the keys but when I got into the place I was shocked! She stripped the place, and took all of the kitchen cabinets, the interior doors, light fixtures, toilet bowls, the hot tub and also stole the above ground pool. \\n\\nI had to pay almost XXXX in order to fix the place up and officially moved back into the house in XXXX XXXX. At that time I reached out to XXXX and was able to negotiate a loan modification with a monthly payment of {$2400.00}.

This resulted in my payment due dates being pushed forward-so at XXXX point I did n't have a payment due for 1 year out. I made a decision in late XXXX to utilize that feature of the pushed forward payment date because I needed the extra cash. It was not a forbearance or income continent loan. My statement indicated that I did n't owe a payment for close to a year and I did n't make the payment. I understood interest would accrue. However, at no point via my statement or a separate letter did Wells Fargo inform me that when I resumed payments they would only applied to the interest accrued during the timeframe. Also they did n't notify me of the amount accrued during the time and how long it would take to pay it off. It was n't until XXXX XXXX that I started to realize my balance was n't decreasing at all. I was set up for auto payments and saw several adjustments include XXXX reductions for my monthly payments. It was messaged to me that the reductions were to ensure I stayed on track towards the end term date. When you are on auto payment, you do n't have a choice to not have your payments adjusted they do it based on the monthly re-amortization. Now, I have two years of accrued interest that must be paid and I am still accruing interest while i '' m paying that off. They informed me that I likely would have a balloon payment at the end of my loan term to account for the additional time to pay off this accrued interest. There was a complete lack of transparency regarding this process, the impact of my decisions and my ability as a consumer to make an informed decision. If I did n't call and ask all of these questions, I still would n't know what was happening. They shared that they no longer have this practice but I had been grandfathered in. Lucky me! Wells Fargo went out of their way to provide just the bare minimum of information via statements and their website without any concern about the impact to the consumer.\",\n",

I have tried to ommunicate this error with the company directly multiple times, and the company only ever says they are reporting correctly, and that is is the credit bureaus faul, which is incorrect. A collections company should not be reporting a charge off status as they were not the ones who extended the credit to begin with, and they should ot be reporting as a revolving account.',\n",

I reached out to this company after receiving correspondence about a student defaulted student loan. Once I asked them to verify who I was sending information to, I was held in contempt for refusing to verify demographics. From my understanding of the law this company should not have been able to proceed with wage garnishment if I was working with them to rectify the problem. They constantly harassed me with threats of wage garnishments and said that my income tax was due to be garnished as well. The more information I sent this company, the more information they used against me. I worked three extra trips in XXXX to be able to pay off classes at XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. So, I could continue taking classes in XXXX. My wages was garnished for XXXX on the XXXX of XXXX and on the XXXX of XXXX a total of XXXX or more.

On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX who said the check was issued XX/XX/XXXX! She promised to stop payment and have it reissued through the Cashiers Dept and would call us by XX/XX/XXXX.

       " 'Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs \\'\\', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX XXXX statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. \\n\\nAlthough I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.\\n\\n1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.\\n\\n2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.\\n\\n3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.\\n\\n4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.\\n\\n5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.\\n\\n6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..',\n",

You will also see the reporting is inconsistent across all 3 reporting agencies for example one of my reports shows 90 days late the  next month 120 days late and then next month back down to 60 days late how is this even possible. How can a account be on time in XXXX and then 120 days past due in XXXX when 120 days have not past between periods. I am requesting they remove these misleading inaccurate late payments as it is causing me great hardship I have already been rejected from one lending opportunity because of this please help me correct this misleading information thank you. I have attached my credit report showing my good history until their reporting error as well as my bank statements showing I made my payments on time every month.\",\n",

       " 'I am writing to you for an issue I have been dealing with for over 2 years now. I have attached all the documents that I kept track of during the process of this project. I will be brief as I can with what has happened.. \\n.Lowes was hired to do my kitchen project. I had to pay all money upfront, which I should have never agreed on, but that was their terms. I had faith in such a large company to compete this project professionally. Also, on their terms, they voided their contract after not completing the project in 3 months. I actually took them 37 weeks to get it done to the point it was functional. Lowes messed up all my flooring. They installed the wrong tiles in some places. They removed of it and replaced it. The contractor did not replace it correctly and I had issues with the tiles cracking, all the grout coming out. There were other issues causing problems as you will read below. Their project manager never came back to oversee the project, I requested he not come back and they bring in someone new. No one never came. Their contractor walked off the job holding material, which I ended up having to manage to tell a new contractor what was needed. Lowes didnt even know what to do. \\nI stayed home to work for many, many days when I was expecting for a contractor to come. I even kept track of the days I was home and my own hourly rate. I have attached this as well. \\nSo after many conversations with Lowes, they kept saying to me that they will not settle or fix anything until they were able to get things in the kitchen done. Well, they ignored the issues with the floors and they kept telling me that we can discuss that after. Repeatedly I kept hearing the same thing. So when the contractor was done with kitchen part, they offered me a {$500.00} gift card. Never offering to fix the flooring issues. Then I filed my first dispute with Synchrony Bank refusing and stopped paying on the card. Lowes offered me {$8900.00} dollars back to give me a credit for my floor. Ok, I said I accept that, but that still doesnt resolve the issues that were caused by your mistakes, you are only giving me back what I paid for. I received a check for {$8000.00} not what they originally told me. I again said that this was still only a credit. I filled repeated disputes with Synchrony Bank about this issue. Lowes would not cover anything with their warranty. They told me that once I cashed that check that they would stop negotiating with me. First off, there was no signed letter stating this. I never agreed to anything like that and for them to sneak that in is tricky and unprofessional. \\nI filed a report with the better business bureau. I priced up what it would cost for my floors to actually be corrected, which would be over {$20000.00}. I had to glue and support the damaged flooring they installed and would not repair. I had to raise my floors in other parts of my house just to make it flush. This had to be done because you couldnt rip out the floors, which Lowes would not do. \\nSo after the XXXX complaint, and multiple complaints, I received a letter from Synchrony Bank stating that Lowes has already agreed to settle for an additional {$12000.00} with me ( This letter is attached as well ). This was all I wanted, and was happy. This would have paid off the balance and taken care of the issues I have to redo myself. I waited, and waited no check. I called and followed up and no one has any clue as to where this money is. So, Lowes, completely lied to me, to Synchrony Bank about what they did. So, I refuse to this day to pay another dime to this account. It should have been taken care of. \\n\\nToday, I received an affidavit via email from the fraud team. I never filed a fraud claim, and do not accept responsibility for the charges due to the voided terms and conditions on Lowes contract that was breached. Lowes stated they were sending {$12000.00} credit. Where is it? I am one person again this Billion dollar company, and they cant even get their story straight and have never accepted responsibility for these mistakes. \\n\\nSynchrony bank since then has been damaging my credit due to this issue.

       " \"I would like to explore the feasibility of holding my mortgage servicer accountable for what I deem a deliberate and prejudicial attempt to delay or deny myself and others from mortgage assistance opportunities, with the express interest to foreclose upon our homes. \\n\\nOVERVIEW I have lived in my home for 20 years. Due to loss of income and hardship I have been behind on my mortgage payments for quite some time, and have been working with an attorney to delay foreclosure until such time as I could reasonably get back on my feet and apply for a loan modification. \\n\\n\\nI began the application process for a loan modification review in XXXX of this year and after countless submissions of paperwork and requested documents, Specialized Loan Servicing has exhibited a pattern of conduct that lead me to believe they are deliberately stalling my application for mortgage assistance, or at minimum become negligent in the duties to serve the consumer. \\n\\n\\nPATTERN OF ACTIVITIES They have rejected documents multiple times claiming they were not legible despite all of them being emailed as high resolution pdf files and / or digital photos. \\n\\nThey have claimed erroneously that some documents were not signed even though they were. \\n\\nThey have claimed to have not received some documents while receiving others, from the same email correspondence to them. \\n\\nThey have neglected to return a single phone call despite requesting call back from my point of contact and multiple times. \\n\\nThey have hung up on me as I requested clarification as to why they are making erroneous claims about documents. \\n\\nThey have cited irrelevant details about documents as a basis for rejecting them, such as expiration date of driver 's license not being legible among many others. \\n\\nThey have agreed on the phone to have received all documentation on multiple occasion only to then tell me a week later that they have a list of things still outstanding, things that I had already submitted. \\n\\nThey have delayed my loan modification application process to where original documents have now expired and the entire process needs to start over. \\n\\nWhile it may seem like I am a disgruntled consumer, My experience despite going back and forth with them on the phone countless times, is they they have no intention of servicing my request for mortgage assistance, and have only sent me on a wild goose chase of document submission and resubmission, only to drag it out as long as they can to foreclosure trial. \\n\\n\\nOUTCOME I believe in my experience with Specialized Loan Servicing that they have given me the run around on purpose. I believe that a secondary hypothesis is that they are highly negligent. The consumer is being harmed adversely as I am about to lose my home, and possibly their negligence or run around is being done to push me to a foreclosure trial with no intent to try and help with mortgage programs supposedly made available to us. \\n\\nMy outcome is to hold Specialized Loan Servicing accountable to their negligence and actions.\",\n",

Now that I have 30 years with the XXXX, retirement is my next step. So I completed the paperwork in XXXX for the Forgiveness Program. The first response I received was that I did not qualify. \\nI went back and did some research and applied again in XXXX and received the response that I was not employed with an eligible organization. \\nSo, I dug a little deeper and called to speak with someone at the organization that holds the loan, Navient.

Next, the loan was sold to Sally Mae and they were still consolidated to be eligible for the Program. From Sally Mae they were sold to Navient and suddenly they are not eligible for the Program. I was told by Navient that I could consolidate them now but the 120 required payments, or 10 years worth of payments would have to start over.

I was only provided with the reduced payment amount and nothing else. I was not given any information on how the payments would affect my loan nor was i given an amortization schedule for the new loan payments. \\n\\nCustomers who qualify for reduced loan payments would gladly choose to have somewhat higher payment amounts if they find out that the reduced payment amount would not be affecting the balance on the loan. Essentially, the income based repayment is just a way for the loan company to make more money in the form of interest payments while the consumer gets no real debt relief. Once the loan gets recapitalized, the customer goes back to square one with respect to the balance of the loan. \\n\\nI am a firm believer in personal responsibility and for consumers taking responsibility for their decisions. However, this practice is deceitful and is harmful to student loan borrowers who are already saddled with large amounts of debt. Customers should be provided with new loan terms whenever adjustments are made to existing loans in order for them to make better decisions.',\n",

I contacted Westlake again and spoke with Westlake Supervisor/XXXX XXXX and let him know that XXXX Specialist/XXXX  was on the conference call to confirm not only the cashier check {$7200.00} was not lost in the mail but Westlake cashed it and cashed the replacement cashier check {$7200.00} making total amount {$14000.00} cashed for ( 1 ) auto loan payoff initial amount {$7100.00}. Creating over-payment and reimbursement {$7200.00} needs to be mailed to XXXX immediately. Westlake/XXXX  confirmed and stated the reimbursement funds will be mailed to XXXX and got the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX/XXXX  to exactly where to send reimbursement funds. \\nWestlake openly refuses to send reimbursement funds {$7200.00} to XXXX and have stop billing me for an account that has been paid in full and needs to be closed, immediately. Westlake knowingly doubled paid themselves in the amount of {$14000.00} for ( 1 ) payoff initial  debt amount {$7100.00} and continue to charge bogus fees to the same account is unconscionable conduct and fraudulent behavior that is unacceptable and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) needs to sanction and alleviate such company actions expeditiously.I contacted Westlake Portfolio Management LLC ; Westlake/Group President/XXXX XXXX ; Westlake/Chairman of the Board/XXXX XXXX, via phone and emails all to no avail. Once Westlake knowingly or should have known cashed the checks for payment is considered to be Acceptance of the Offer and extinguishes the debt, not in some but the debt in entirety.\",\n",

       " 'XX/XX/XXXX CFPB Complaint on fraudulent 14 year old HELOC foreclosure complaint Dear CFPB, All the information below is easily verified by documentation and telephone recordings with all relevant parties. Please find below, the relevant information and documents necessary for your review of what we and others know to be a fraudulent, illegal, undocumented attempt to take our home via an illegal foreclosure complaint based on a previously discharged, then cancelled, then time barred, then discharged again due to statute of limitations, on a 14 year old home equity line of credit, ( HELOC ) loan for {$32000.00} Per your requested 5 step protocol, please see the following. \\n\\n1. What is the complaint about? We are a XXXX year old pro se defendant couple with very little knowledge of the foreclosure process who are trying to fight a fraudulent foreclosure action on a 14 year old home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) for which there is no longer proper verification available to pro se defendants and consumers according to almost all relevant third party sources statements to us, as well as obvious attempts to obstruct our getting the proper documentation required to defend ourselves, if it even exists. \\nOur complaint concerns the legitimacy of almost every aspect of the foreclosure action against us, from the origination irregularities sited by XXXX XXXX, to procedural violations, lack of standing, lack of complete and proper documentation and response, multiple redactions, possible fraudulent and misleading, contradictory recorded statements involving multiple parties engaged in the processing, holding, transfer violations, embezzlement, and/or the non application of a 1099-C cancellation of debt sited in documents issued by 2 Federal agencies, XXXX XXXX and the IRS. There are multiple issues in the improper origination of this loan that are a matter of record and constitute issues of material fact. There has been a consistent and deliberate lack of transparency as well as attempts to conceal, mislead and otherwise create confusion and ambiguity concerning the status and legitimacy of this debt, resulting in documented malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance by multiple parties involved and therefore restricting the consumers rights to due diligence and thus harming our constitutional right of due process, in defending ourselves as pro se defendants, against this unsupported fraudulent foreclosure action against our home of 33 years. \\n\\nWe believe, and are confident we can prove the illegal action against us to be a fraudulent attempt to collect a fraudulent debt, by corrupted third party defendants and plaintiffs that we believe do not have legal standing in an attempt to collect what we believe to be a previously resolved debt, which therefore represents an illegal action against us. This is clearly a thinly veiled attempt to bully homeowners into settling with pretender lenders on fraudulently trumped up, unsupported, time barred debts to target defendants that do not have financial means to defend themselves in hopes of bullying, blackmailing and extorting payment in lieu of and without affordable legal defense, which is why we need your assistance to making them provide all documents relating to and relevant to their claims of standing to collect this fraudulent, previously resolved, time barred debt, the legitimacy of the debt they have acquired, and the process by which they acquired the debt, including all billing and payment documents, interest and time stamped balances to document their debt totals claims made in their complaint over the life of the loan, all notifications sent to us of any and all title transfers, any 1099-C cancellation transactions associated with this loan. We request any and all documents relating to this loan be sent to us, including all private and public agencies documents including XXXX XXXX and all transfer and billing records going back to the origination of the loan forward, as are required by law by the current alleged owners of the debt, verification of the debt and a copy of the judgment. These illegal activities represent consumer fraud, predatory fraudulent debt collection, undocumented, obstructive and non-transparent actions against consumers and borrowers without proper and complete documentation or just cause to do so. \\n\\nFurther we believe this may very well involve mail fraud, abuse of process, misleading and untruthful statements we have recorded and fraud on many levels by multiple parties due to gross lack of due diligence in originating and illegally transferring this loan. PNC had knowledge of the 1099-C cancellation document but did not follow up to be sure it was properly applied to our account. \\n\\n2. What type of problem are we having? Obstruction, misleading information and a total lack of transparency. Upon multiple inquiries to all the parties involved from the origination of this loan forward, we were told this loan was too old to have any proper documentation. After not having heard anything from anyone for 9 years, my wife and I suddenly encountered all of the following : which includes everything from a total lack of cooperation to downright obstruction of our efforts to properly research, defend or respond to this foreclosure complaint on our home of 33 years. Our first mortgage has been current for many years now. But we have gotten no billing, inquiries, annual statements, notifications, nothing for 9 years concerning this HELOC 2nd mortgage until very recently for this foreclosure action with the sole exception of a 1099-C in XX/XX/XXXX, from 2 federal agencies ; XXXX XXXX and the IRS that should have cancelled this loan, as documentation of the cancellation required us to pay taxes on this cancelled loan. This happened at exactly the same time our 1st mortgage was sold. When our 1st mortgage was sold, we received the 1099-C cancellation of debt shortly after and all communication concerning the HELOC ceased until this complaint was filed almost 8 years later in late XXXX. We have experienced a total lack of any proper response and transparency after repeated requests by the Ohio Attorney Generals office and others for all necessary and relevant information, proper documentation and cooperation necessary for us to defend ourselves in this fraudulent, illegal foreclosure complaint. We have encountered a substantial, deliberate and damaging lack of transparency, cooperation, consistency of response in an attempt to engage and respond to plaintiffs ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) complaint of foreclosure on our home, to include, but are not limited to multiple redactions in documents, conflicting, contradictory, misleading and inconsistent explanations of fact from multiple parties involved, conflicting documentation, non responses for information, all of which have delayed and denied our due diligence and therefore necessarily, our constitutionally guaranteed due process rights in defending this legal action against us and harmed our ability to properly respond, and defend ourselves against this foreclosure action in the courts. Additionally, in our attempt to defend ourselves we have encounters multiple redactions, intentionally misleading statements, multiple contradiction to the same question from the same parties and a total lack of cooperation to downright obstruction in our attempts to respond to these false claims and to defend ourselves and our home. \\n\\nWe have been told repeatedly, by multiple third parties, involved relevant parties and previous owners of this debt, that this loan is simply too old to have proper documentation on this 14 year old loan, yet this complaint is based on what the Plaintiffs claim is sufficient documentation that it has failed to produce in its entirety. We have received no billing, inquiries, annual statements, notifications, judgment, nothing for 8 plus  yearsconcerning this HELOC 2nd mortgage until very recently for this foreclosure action with the sole exception of the aforementioned 1099-C, cancellation statement form issued by XXXX XXXX and the IRS, requiring us to pay taxes on this cancelled debt in XXXX of XXXX. The efforts by XXXX XXXX, National City Bank ( now merged with PNC ) PNC Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX law firm XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX attorneys for plaintiff ) have only further created ambiguity and confusion for my wife and I in our ability to properly defend and respond to this foreclosure complaint by their lack of proper response for complete documentation of the legitimacy of this collection effort. We are unable to afford an attorney and unable to obtain the representation of an attorney at this time. But that may not always be the case, based on new information we have uncovered in our own research and defense of this complaint. We believe this case deserves to be investigated as to regulatory and procedural violations that would inform the need for counterclaims / cross claims, related to malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance and its broader implications to move the law to the benefit of untold numbers of home owners and consumers victimized by the illegal practices. \\n\\nAdditionally, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent us a warning letter without proper language concerning our right to dispute. The original collection letters did not tell us we had the right to dispute their allegations and complaint, but specifically stated -- only what we would need to do if we did try to dispute their claims. The letter was very specific and states clearly that we have the right to reinstate after acceleration and other stipulations but somehow fails to clearly state our rights to dispute -- clearly stated for the consumer. This is very misleading, by omission, to many I am sure and not the intention of the law and what it in fact actually requires which is to inform us that we have the right to dispute this debt in court and otherwise. It is hard imagine with such specificity on other topics and rights clearly stated within the document that this was simply an oversight and not intended to diminish and marginalize a consumers rights to dispute as required by law.! \\n\\n3. What happed? THE 1099-C CANCELLING OF DEBT, SENT BY THE IRS, DATED XX/XX/XXXX AND FILED BY XXXX XXXX 2 FEDERAL AGENCIES, WAS NOT, AND HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY APPLIED AND THEREFORE REPRESENT FRAUDULENT AND RECKLESS ABANDONMENT BY THE OWNERS OF THE LOAN, IN AN ATTEMPT WRITE OFF, CANCEL, DIVIDE THE LOAN, DISCHARGE MULTIPLE TIMES, TO ILLEGALLY TRANSFER A FRAUDULENT, ILL CONCEIVED DEBT, THAT CAN NOT BE SEPARATED OUT FROM THE OBVIOUS CONFUSION, CONFLICTS AND CONTRADICTION CREATED BY THE ORIGINATORS OF THE LOAN PNC AND THE OTHER PARTIES INVOLVED IN WHAT ANY REASONABLE PERSON WOULD SEE AS A CONCERTED, COORDINATED, CONSISTENT RACKETEERING EFFORT TO UNLAWFULLY TRANSFER AND OR COLLECT WHAT IS AND SHOULD BE A NON EXISTENT, TIME BARRED, PREVIOULY CANCELLED DEBT, RIDDLED WITH FALSE & MISLEADING STATEMENTS, ORIGINATION AND TRANSFER IRREGULARITIES AND VIOLATIONS AND ILLEGALLY CREATED ORIGINATION IRREGULARITIES, OMISSIONS, AND VIOLATIONS HAVE CREATED AND GIVEN RISE TO MULTIPLE ISSUES OF MATERIAL FACT. We also have received demands for multiple conflicting sums and experienced Dual Actions during the negotiation of our loan modification which did not show the proper application of the 1099-C cancellation of debt, otherwise we would have included. what we then thought to be a cancelled debt, in our modification negotiation, therefore harming and damaging our legitimate financial options and well being. XXXX XXXX has confirmed the 1099-C cancellation they sent to the IRS, but they, PNC and others third parties claim the loan is too old and can not or will not provide requested information for tracking this action so we can confirm relevant details of who, when and how these illegal actions took place. The foreclosure complaints accuracy is very much in doubt, from the amounts claimed to be owed, procedural violations and lack of due diligence, to abuse of process, illegal and misleading title transfers, and multiple redactions restricting and obstructing our ability to defend ourselves to clarify what we believe to be deliberate, documentable counter/cross claims on multiple levels, as it relates to who was and was not the legal owners, who had standing to collect and service the illegally conceived and executed loan during 8 years without any communications. There is total obstruction of all information concerning the timing, ownership and lack of proper application of the 1099-C cancellation of debt, statute of limitations issues and the illegality of attempting to transfer a non negotiable instrument. We requested, because of the above stated obstruction, and were subsequently granted a 60 extension by the court, for the specific above stated reasons, in hopes of untangling all the ambiguity, obstruction, misleading and fraudulent information, facilitated by plaintiffs and other above stated third parties in a coordinated effort to deny consumers access to this relevant information and documentation if it does in fact even exist in reality. I am told it is only a denial of my rights of due process if plaintiffs dont supply that information to the court but how would the average consumer compel that response without legal counsel? This is not justice, fair or the spirit of the law in securing consumers due process in defending themselves, particularly with regard to proper foreclosure defense. We have discovered in this process, issues of material fact, and much to our surprise, that a XXXX cancellation of debt, issued by XXXX XXXX and the IRS that PNC bank was aware of, was not properly applied. In fact it was not applied at all from what we have found. We assume since the 1099-C was issued by the IRS, that the owners of the loan at that time PNC Bank or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that all parties must have been and should have been aware of this cancellation of debt issued by the XXXX XXXX XXXX were used as a tax write off for the bank but were not properly, if at all, applied to our loan, but were realized by PNC BankXXXX XXXX  And then later benefited from selling the loan to other parties. Therefore, there are tens of thousands of dollars of cancelled debt that were NOT applied by PNC or XXXX to our account and is therefore missing from our account while PNC, who owned both our 1st mortgage and HELOC loan, having committed grave origination illegalities, dividing and separating what originated as a single loan, when closing both these no doc, interest only loans on the same day. PNC sold our 1st mortgage in XXXX of XXXX. But after the 1st mortgage was sold, the HELOC disappeared completely, only to suddenly resurface in late XXXX after almost 9 years, except for the 1099-C cancellation of debt document that we received in XXXX, 3 plus months after PNC sold our mortgage, leading us to believe the 1099-C had been properly applied to our HELOC which completely disappeared off the radar at that same time. PNC stated in recordings to me, that they discharged our HELOC in XXXX, when they sold our 1st mortgage at that same time, then subsequently cancelled our HELOC, BURIED IT WITH NO COMMUNICATIONS TO US, sold our loans to other companies, then got it back, discharged it again due to the statute of limitations in XXXX of XXXX, then sold this HELOC again, after 2 discharges and 1 cancellation of the debt, THEN SOLD IT in late XXXX, AND ALL THE WHILE HAVING NOT PROPERLY APPLIED THE CANCELLATION OF DEBT ISSUED BY 2 FEDERAL AGENCIES. Again, I have all these statements recorded and therefore can be transcribed for you and the court. We have applied for numerous loans over the years, since XXXX when we received the 1099-C cancellation of debt and this loan did not show up on our credit reports and was never mentioned as existing, delinquent, defaulted or as an issue of any kind in the loan application process and granting of the loans. XXXX XXXX XXXX  granted us a home equity loan recently but those funds seem to have been frozen upon the filing of this fraudulent foreclosure complaint, thus damaging, harming and limiting our ability to access those funds for needed repairs on our home, and crippled our financial planning in preparing for our retirement WHICH WE BELIEVE CLEARLY CREATES DOCUMENTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE FILING THIS FRAUDULENT COMPLAINT AGAINST US AS WELL AS FOR OTHER 3RD PARTIES. IN CONCLUSION, simply stated, it is easily verified that PNC owned both loans from XXXX, discharged our HELOC, in late XXXX, took the tax write off, was aware of the XXXX XXXX and IRS directed cancellation of debt to our loans, then buried our HELOC, without a word, for 9 years, sold it in late XXXX, and according to recordings I have of our conversations where they stated that they discharged it again in XXXX of XXXX, culminating in their fraudulently discharging our debt multiple times, not properly cancelling and applying the 1099-C cancellation of debt, per XXXX XXXX & IRS, 2 federal agencies directives, and then illegally and fraudulently selling this debt 12 years later. Just in the last year or so we have heard from 2 different law firms, and 3 different collection agencies and servicers on the same cancelled debt including different amounts due and different interests rates, no payment histories to support their false claims of how much is owed and as to who has the right to collect these differing amounts and we are relatively sure there were 2 or  more collection agencies trying to collect on the same debt and with different amounts required. Further, PNC was pursuing foreclosure while we were trying to work out a modification and mediation which we know is highly illegal. The statute of limitation in Ohio is now based on retroactively applied changes made in XXXX establishing it as 6 years for promissory notes and/or loan documents that function as promissory notes which makes this note time barred in Ohio. \\n\\n4. What company is this complaint about? XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Foreclosure complaint This complaint involves XXXX XXXX, National City Bank, the loan originators in XX/XX/XXXX, until XXXX when they merged with PNC, then it sold to U.S Mortgage XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, then to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Because no proper due diligence was done these were improperly transfers of this fraudulent, defective and illegal loan in between PNC and XXXX XXXX XXXX, but XXXX XXXX XXXX filed the foreclosure complaint via XXXX XXXX  XXXX, attorneys for plaintiffs, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ohio, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who signed the complaint is no longer with that firm and so our certified mail, addressed to both attorneys has been returned to us, leaving us as pro se attorneys wondering who, what, if, when and how this complaint is moving forward and if our efforts to defend ourselves are being ignored, subjugated, invalidated, lost, or dismissed???? Servicers ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 5. Who are the people involved. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX -- attorneys for plaintiff below XXXX, Ohio, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) 6. What we are requesting : A full investigation into this highly irregular, very likely fraudulent and documented foreclosure action based on issues of material fact. All document relating to this complaint from all parties listed in this complaint to include but are not limited to the following which plaintiffs would be required to have to properly support claims alleged in this complaint. Judgement from the court against defendants dated XX/XX/XXXX with all relevant documents and complete payment and billing statements to support claims of XXXX owed dating from XX/XX/XXXX to present- XX/XX/XXXX as alleged in the complaint. All annual statements, banking records and documents from any person or company that engaged in any way with the origination, processing, taking of payments, collections, servicing, or ownership of this loan from origination to the present XX/XX/XXXX Plaintiffs, legal counsels licensing to represent out of state companies in collecting debts here in Ohio. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, licensing and proof of standing to pursue out of state legal actions including foreclosure actions here in Ohio Provide any and all relevant information and documentation, dates and names of all parties engaged in the origination, processing, taking of payments, collections, transfers, assignments, allonges or ownership to support and document allegations asserted in plaintiffs foreclosure complaint, which any reasonable person would assume the plaintiffs would have in their possession in order to support any legitimate, legal and proper complaint to facilitate due process rights of pro se defendants and justify just cause via plaintiffs required due diligence, respect for this process and burden of proof clearly required by the law and the spirit of the law. \\n\\n7. In Conclusion : We believe plaintiff purchased a illegitimate, non transferable, corrupted and defective instrument, defunct, compromised and therefore voided loan that has multiple legal issues creating issues of material fact that excludes them from having any standing to buy, sell, attempt to collect or take any legal action involving this loan, not the least of which is the lack of documentation due to its age and compromised and corrupted history and if this is not the case please provide full documentation to satisfy what the law would require as your burden of proof of your allegations in this complaint. Plaintiffs cant explain, much less prove to a judge and / or jury, beyond a reasonable doubt how the legitimacy, accuracy, intentions, timeliness, legality, procedural integrity, payment history, 1099-C Cancellation of debt failures, and other issues of material fact documented throughout the history of our loan/loans that seem to be undertaken to, and resulting in, gross nonfeasance, malfeasance and misfeasance repeatedly harming defendants and their ability to defend themselves. Our documents will prove, gross neglect and malfeasance as plaintiffs and other 3rd parties involved, lack of due diligence resulted in manipulation and corruption of the loans originations, randomly dividing the loan into pieces on what was intended to be a single loan from its inception, transfers, their failure to properly notify us about transfers, we believe fraudulently, with the probable intent to intentionally mislead, evade, generally create ambiguity, omit and obscure material information designed to intentionally hide information and tracking of the loan by pro se defendants and therefore did harm defendants due process rights in their attempts to properly defend themselves in this foreclosure complaint. It is clear that the illegal mishandling of this loan has been institutionalized throughout the lending, ownership and servicing process, creating an incentive to discourage transparency and accountability for consumers and homeowners, for which the entire system was designed to properly serve and protect as the final stakeholder and end user of the transaction! Therefore further investigation is necessary and wanting in this familiar practice attempted by large private banks to defraud homeowners and consumers through an unnecessarily and overly burdensome process to illuminate the issues, facts and relevant documents to resolve this issue outside of court if possible or through the legal system if necessary, therefore seriously harming and damaging homeowners and consumers legal rights of due process and self defense as in the case of my family as pro se defendants. In the clear light and spirit of the law this complaint should and must, be thoroughly investigated to ensure transparency, accountability and fairness to support homeowners and consumers to be sure the burden of proof is illuminate for the homeowner and consumers benefit, as a last resort and recourse as pro se defendants, to further attain and help confirm the truth and facts as required for justice to be served in deed, in law, in process and in the spirit of accountability in hopefully moving the law forward for many future outcomes, and as the law requires in order to find a fair, accountable and just outcome for the parties involved and for those who it can help to protect in the future. We believe plaintiff purchased a illegitimate, non transferable, corrupted and defective instrument, defunct, compromised and therefore voided loan that has multiple legal issues creating issues of material fact that excludes them from having any standing to buy, sell, attempt to collect or take any legal action involving this loan, not the least of which is the lack of documentation due to its age and compromised and corrupted history and if this is not the case please provide full documentation to satisfy what the law would require as your burden of proof of your allegations in this complaint. In recent years events clearly shows the corrupt culture of the national banking system and the damage repeatedly done to consumers and to the economy as a whole.
